i mean if you were ever late because of that its not well find a way around it and ive put you guys on mondays at this time for my convenience but its not like its important well i was just basically getting out but i wanted to make it in time but its just because all the leaves and things the trains werent stopping at the stations so i decided to speak for stations on youre just sleeting past you really yeah great so what they have to do back up im not sure but then the busing people in this cruise station have particularly problems like theres on a hill or something so i had to bus people in from stations either side yeah masty yeah but yeah at least it was prerestrictions instead of like trains flying past into various things yeah were glad they look after that bit oh yeah i dont know do we want to look at anything its not up yet still 56 confusing i can skip it isnt it just doing a disc check or something i dont know what its doing rips it fella doesnt like silk stay and now were going to discover weve got no reason to meet right because everythings going swiingly well you know apart of problem apart from waiting for the get contagious sort of because i havent read the wikis in my email since i left so yeah i havent added anything to wiki recently so ive been working on trying to get the xml stuff working so basically doing how to have the dom works so i can do the next so i can generate the ddf files oh yeah so yeah so i just just just read three docentation thats what was doing the end last week just someone i know how it all works and both of you have the best way to do things but at the moment im playing about the dom stuff in zilla because just so i can see how it works with the html pages so i can generate the x so i can generate xhml stuff and see how it all works there this was much easier to just see how things work in that well i dont know the mizzela stuff so if it turns out that its idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits then it wont have been a good idea well the api is standardized by the w3c so the api is standing between everything well there are certain companies that i dont want to name we dont always get it right but yeah mizzela yeah itll be all right yeah yeah yeah its just as a coon i believe you now its a good strategy yeah yeah well yeah well it doesnt like me so this is a mizzelaonly feature and things like that so ive been avoiding those anyway its just that thats quite a quick way to just to get into how the dom works because i can just quickly generate a web page and just add things to it and take things away and see exactly whats going on at the time so what why does it help for the text html just xml just because xhml has a nice you know that you got browsers there so you can actually see you can actually see directly whats going on most browsers when you put an xml file up in it itll just apply some default styles to it anyway that shows you yeah well im using xhml so all the web pages are xhml so its xml just with the html dtd okay yeah just a bit of difficulty i havent quite finalized the gdf format so youre going to have to do a swap in tagnames later yeah so all i have to do is change that sort of thing everybodys got their different ways of doing these things im sure thats fine i mean it also comes out in the end yeah no im just trying to think of the things that could go wrong but since i havent tried it this particular way you know but yeah that sounds good so you say we havent finalized what the gdf looks like is that an implicit request for me to do something or no well what im doing the moment im looking through the stuff thats throwing in front of the wiki to say what we need in the output format for the task so what youre going to do the analysis on so im making sure that i can take that information out of the gdf as its state at the moment if i find something that you cant get out of it then i can add that to the gdf format yeah as a well i mean theres two cases in here right theres things you can get straight off the original format and then theres things you have to do some kind of postprocessing of the original format but its not just a data format change its actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well right yeah yeah and it wasnt i think it was a little bit confused last time we spoke about whether you consider gdf format to be the thing thats just straightforward translations of whats in the original eye tracking output or whether like whether the postprocessing utilities are a separate step because i think you and i had separate different views on this but i cant remember who had which view have this point yeah well so are you working on actively on this analysis things or are you just working on the translation well im trying im making sure that the gdf format weve got in the moment well well outputs they well ive got an old in assets that robyns looking for so im using it as a way to get into using the dom things as well so yeah so the moment im looking at actually the gdf format itself and then to generate the gdf format im going to be taking stuff out of the jest analyzer and then using the dom parser to generate xwater okay so you have a little bit of whats in there and what isnt in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do no no but the output of the jest analyzer does do some of the processing already which is what im planning to use as the basis for it because that already picks up target readers and things like that so it knows whether youre looking at a part or whether youre looking at target area or whatever so yeah so theres always got that in it somewhere so im just going to pull that out and put that into the gdf okay so this sounds like its under control when youre happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know so i dont need to do anything right nope youre all fine but there was a nber of things that came before this right it sounds like theyre not under control yet so you know the gdf stuff so ellens view on this is we go through everything in order like the priority is exactly the pipeline order right yeah so camtasia you mentioned yeah and im not sure what else but we should check what other things will before this and ill ask you things to do yeah yeah i think the other thing ive got left to leave before the experience we run is get the check camtasia works no weve got camtasia running on machines and i think thats up correctly but i cant test it until we get the mic friends working until you get the microphones oh microphones its batteries were waiting for batteries yeah theyre due i was told the beginning this week okay are they really really strange batteries they are quite strange have you tried mappler its abrol has ordered them from some person i think so no no no developed like 150 each or something like that because you know like we bus journey over to mapplin might solve the problem if its getting in the way well hopefully that they should have been here last week but caroline then flew in to chase them and they were told to be here should be today so this isnt actually ruining your schedule for anything and thats why youre waiting well we can still test whether camtizia runs anyway its just the whether its the microphones are picking up things correctly right okay so it sounds like youre not actually worried about the fact that this is not yet yeah when you get worried go to mapplin okay phone and first to make sure that theyre in there somebody around must have a police steve somebody in the techie group will have a mapplin catalog okay ill see if i can its useful to know whos got a current one anyway i dont seem to get them anymore i guess they dont buy enough equipment only must have stopped lying these days anyways no oh yeah of course d so you can find out whether they have it but youd have to phone them and find out if they havent stopped on that i actually lived not that far from that so it would be half our diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff but then again its also very close to hey market yeah so its even less of a diversion for you except you dont know your way around i can easily get to mapplin i dont worry stuff are you slivissa i dont know i just live here on my gig i know were doing i know were mapplin yeah i just think well you know the mistake of three quid or however many quid how many betters is the sink deck doesnt take a hundred no its two batteries we need yeah then you know put your mind at rest you know you wouldnt want it to be the morning that was supposed to be recording thats what makes this guy you know you know this i suppose i could give you a call in the way in tomorrow and if not pay the bill then ill just go you know this i suppose i could give you a call in the way in tomorrow and if not pay the bill in your pigeonhole like an easy gun for training early and just pick them up from there yeah check theyve got them first the stocks are a bit funny down there right yeah well im making sure im making that and make sure ive got the phone nber and my phone so i can call them because you know its not bad attractive in area to walk through if youre not going to get any of the kind of things well true true so thats the way it is so of all the things that were on the wiki do i need to pull up the wiki no its going to let me log in its still probably the end yeah no i do not want to change my password but you guys probably know off the top of your head is there anything else that we were waiting on before you could run remember so all those tasks were i can have a set of things the only thing thats cool to me slightly up is checking whether jews finished there is a working model builder but im not sure if its the finished version yet his last day was the 31st of october yeah he still had hours left i wasnt sure if it was down to the nber of hours or where the 31st of october oh yeah no its hours yeah its hours i was so hes got hours left hes behind him i think he was building for he was building by the hour so i thought well i mean obviously if he wants to finish off then you know im nine nine megan has gone dead for almost the last two weeks oh well theyre probably away then well theyre really the same place well theyre really the same place well i dont know theyre really the same place no i think what they had was some big review oh yeah it could be it and so i havent heard anything back from them so the models for oh you have no models at all oh thats a pity model builder thats what i was calling a graphical model editor right so you use xpig to make the parts and then you well we dont need to make the parts are all the standard 10 gram ones out before anyway the xpig thing was only when we come to building airplanes and you peculiar shapes but for this experiment its just a 10 gram type test okay i have something in my email about from joe he wouldnt have sent it just to me would he do you want to check that im not going to project my email yes ill tell you that one way that means you didnt leave anything per day and anything from you for a week or so anyway okay i think i might have heard theres a i cant remember exactly what it was thats a new way then its the last thing in response to the thing i was seeing last week the parallelalground being the only round from the model yeah yeah thats also a screenshot yeah nothing has i havent heard anything since from either i say the method ones are from you okay i think thats something on the 28th thats friday i think oh he just wants to know how to get paid right that suggests hes done done done anyway hes in adams breast so well i suppose he wont come back as kricks on his desk it was he back yeah right okay so well im using the nice machine so if ones to pop in for five minutes the windows machines free from at the moment well hes just not going to try to squat there thats all so the last thing ive got from him about work was the 19th of october that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted oh see you didnt get that it was just me and him but presably he put it on the wiki so so hes just telling us because he thinks weve probably dont read wiki and ill just check yeah it was after that it was the thing about playing the parallelogram it was a mirror image yeah im considering we were getting an email off him yeah i think it got sent through to the group saying that hed updated the whatever it was on the wiki so hed hed uploaded a new zip file never written the old one sir well i havent replied to him about yeah i really dont have anything more more recent from him i havent replied to him about you know how to submit costs and stuff like that but thats just hes at the end of things but we could just ask him i mean maybe you guys just want to ask him directly youre done done right because thats what you guys are knowing and then of course any problems that remain you and harry but its worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want i guess so the problem is you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from meryluse yes or at least she was meant to have some idea of the level of complexity because they have actually run various and to get an idea of the sort of style and to check the bo right all very quiet right have you tried cole calling thats what i do when i need things that no it has just been email rather than telephone tape oh the question if you get them today why dont you start running im down for a week its the seventh week to the evening oh right so you have to be ready by then well i havent written anything yet but thats when im hoping right okay we have been of course put back a bit by track or going down yeah makes sense but were certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of december i think yeah so you dont have subjects lined up but you dont expect any trouble getting them hopefully not the only other site complication is which i think brought up at the meeting on thursday for all the eye tracking users yeah the lab has been blocked booked again by jules from psychology i dont know this person so they well they need to be serious about it whos there is that a staff member or a staff member yeah okay well we kind of paid for the lab so it depends but i suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it lactur right i mean presably he or she is not running subjects the entire well presably not but its sort of quite totally booked for certainly what 60s for 10 to 5 for two or three of those days so ellens still out of town right its just you could try calling this person and see how this works ellen might be more persuasive its just sometimes academic staff have a bit of a chip about research staff and since i dont know the person i cant tell whether its one of those or not i wouldnt no i can probably at least email her and ask her shes really giving it all that pain yeah and that escalates i guess but you know or whether it can be put off for a little bit or something so i have no idea how the booking system works well youre discussing them thursday right well yeah at the moment theres just a booking system yeah and people just i think can log on to it can book it yeah well thats one to raise at the meeting i might talk to ellen about that ahead of time because they may have she and martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab in theory jess is meant to have it every morning oh really yeah but dont you guys set up for isnt black booking more appropriate because isnt there set up involved in chanting around for somebody else there shouldnt be any changes in the physical connection no or in the software or anything no okay so theres no cost associated with it being mornings or afternames no as long as other people dont for some reason i dont know disconnect some bits of equipment theres no reason why it should be so in the worst case you may be able to make an argent if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week is there something thats known outside ellens head yes its on the bookings system its not on the booking system its on a web page that frank created a big lab oh well thats okay but you dont know if anybody actually knows his later well thats the time to yeah so it sounds like youve got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need of course try to be kind to other people but you would anyway so those are the only things that are worrying you camtasia and lab access and otherwise no sweat youre happy ive also got to get camtasia oh its the lot of builders here well yes the model ive got to get camtasia working as a sort of a little multimedia thing to generate a video how to sort of an instructional video oh yeah this is going to take a little while ill have to do this week well im hoping once i go around trial out give you some screenshots to work with and then just be able to add in your video of makes movements or whatever yeah but you were going to try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that oh no you were just really going to run a video of the trial yeah thats as much as you so with the model builder what do you need to do with it which one of you is going to look at what it does so far ill just try and do that have a look any problem with it things are working paid up for that piece of for that thing so you just put whatever recoendations bugs on that page and all work through them as and when i can hopefully theres not a problem i see that marlouis also made to be checking it and doing things how many models were you relying on her for so are you suddenly going to be it hasnt been divided up in that sort of way well what im trying to get at is is your start time going to be delayed because you dont have the models ready if she doesnt come through depends how quickly i manage to get a group of it vivio how long it takes me to generate them or how i get on with the camtasia yeah well im unsure of yet can you draft craig in to build some of this sir at least yeah im not talking about using the software in the last not that hard on them it shouldnt be any great problem its just checking that there are a suitable with all the complexity of it you know me contingency planning obviously i always worry about the worst i know quite quite right yeah you know i want to go ahead and imagine the building the building the building the model is going to be that hard and i can easily just will have many thousands there on that to that website you found just you know pick some of them read in the jct format thats you know its pretty mechanical i can easily do that theres no choice but to choose from which ones you need to do which i guess you have to do oh i was hoping chris could be able to do that oh yeah you need to yeah exactly you can call a just telcon between you and marlouse you know if its not the see you know with a call calling you can usually at least find out whether theyre alive and getting offer to get something but you know the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this were going to talk about it you know twostates its just such a time of lushy yeah its a good time ill try and get hilver again to the simibly whatever it is theyve been going through now over i think it was up till the end of the two parts so presably today theyre now free or taking a week off to recover is it i just take for that to to slow you up and collecting stuff thats all well hopefully it wont anyway its just if i then do it i hope well get the right models yeah thats the thats true so itll be generated its whether the models are optimal or thats quite a small thing she can do for you i guess its not like you know sitting there brain deadly constructing you know some models that she needs to do its just a provided advice about this which must take take less time well that all sounds fine you guys worried about it you worried about anything we mostly have been talking about the experiment schedule so i think the next thing im going to the main thing ill go to today is get this contagious sort of thing out the batteries for that the problems are not worried im not worried youre going to run out of things to do that we havent set you up for any time soon the gdf thing sounds like it might take a wee while yeah yeah because ive got to finalize that format and then once thats done ill go to start looking at the analysis side of it this is all the dynamic region part of it yeah yeah but you dont need anything for me for that because thats already sort of spec i mean again thats the pair of you yeah yeah i think the analysis will take a little while i dont think its going to take that long to get this stuff sorted out its going to be head to display it and all that sort of stuff whatever makes it easiest for you to do this is what im worried about is him being in the lab all day long and youre not being sure what to do for the analysis or something because youre going to be completely unavailable when youre recording or whether youre times when you dont record all day no but it depends how many i can begin and get running and before my brain melts but when the experiments running yeah its ill be in the lab yeah because he might i cant just go in and let them get started in the oh yeah no no no i understood that it was one of the people planned but oh it was more like you know so this week hes got you know the gdf stuff to do then next week youre planning on recording and what happens if suddenly youre unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of work therell certainly be time for now because im right next to the lab anybody else come back just to check my email and things so what were you about then yeah so ive also got to work on the dress analysis and turn that into the gdf outputter and yeah i can have a look at the model builder as well yeah the one thing i think about is were looking at the part building type stuff and it might worth seeing if i can add a little part builder thing into the model builder im just going to tidy up some of the code for generating the parts anyway the jst parts what i dont know if we want to bond with a part builder the idea was it wasnt worth the investment yeah yeah but im going to have a quick look at it and see how easy it is to add a couple of things to it if i can use it to generate the rotimangle for example the rotation syetry which was what was causing the bugs before so if i can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would say quite a bit of work so lets say a few bugs yeah but now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the rotim stuff do you have trouble doing it no no its just something youve got to remember once the parts we build yeah well i mean we might want to severely cache a limit to the investment that you put into making a part builder yeah so how many person days would it be worth like if craig discovered it could be done in x days i wouldnt pull them in one or two certainly right so theres a limit dont spend more than a day or two on it yeah i want to get you worth it yeah you have to understand theres things about this project weve hidden from you so far that youll have to learn about i thought something like a map task like lets rather than wipe my task list oh really oh that would just be a little addon however it is itll be the same skills as youve learned for something else and itll just be im not even sure thats you because i think somebody else is doing that actually but im thinking more of the fact that at some point we should probably tell you about this nxt stuff right yeah well thats just xable to xable to xable isnt it turning gdf oh yeah yeah what up its into nxt but you know theres xml and xml and you know it takes standoff links and stuff its some people that theyre not used to linguistic annotation take a little pun to get their head around the way the data model works right right yeah because theres stuff to learn there so yeah that was the yeah from what weve heard about it is both xml the prograing side of it doesnt say in dhide its going to be making sure that it fits what you expect out the format yeah but now thats fine ill put plenty of questions for you once i get to that stage im sure yeah so just dont order away you know weeks on friepperies when we got the real meat we did this yet to come well find plenty of really really crucial things for you to do yeah and i do think youll be tripling your homes yeah well well do a bit of thing and well go ahead and get camtay just sort of like this week and its on the dress and lies with the gdf stuff and then yeah once weve done that its whatever you do whatever you want me to do once weve done the gdf okay so ill remind myself to look at whats next before the next time we get together yeah yeah im sorry im high on the gdf im pretty busy for a little while yet so yeah well thats all i can say i certainly keep you busy until this time next week and i can sort of suggest things that might need to look at for the next stage yeah so you collect them monday that means you dont want to meet right well at 12 oclock next monday the lab is taking the book to buy jewels oh right its actually next week its actually the week that you were planning on it starts on this wednesday and goes through to next wednesday oh okay well i dont know anyway youll tell me whether we cancel this or whether i just talk to craig in which case we wont be up here because we dont record twos yep okay what else yeah why then other competition is two weeks tomorrow i start my teaching oh yeah thats really fun lets see thats like four lectures and four labs that comes in an ideal time for you then yes thats like the 20th or something i cant add which tomorrow is the first year so itll be the 15th year and the 20th actually yeah that reminds me a lot of what i wont be on thursday im going to be over in the next day oh yeah you have to promise to tell us how that is does people do ask me fair enough i dont think its going to be that in depth its a waste of time to you know scale of one to seven yeah yes i dont expect to be that in depth its 15 minutes on a variety of different topics yeah im sure most of it i already know is like by safety health safety the protection the usual stuff you get everywhere the university will cover itself legally well they were going to do that when they pushed it to go to it i would and i wouldnt know somebody whod gone to know nobodys pulled it so far im pretty sure they didnt have induction in my day so well i dont remember being asked for an induction really but you only started here in april there was supposed to im sure yeah my mother would have id go invited to a suer garden party for new staff members but that was but thats all oh well when i started being a student we had the induction as a compulsory because a lot of students were doing teaching and you couldnt do the teaching unless youd done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and by safety before you could take a charge of yeah because you were the responsible person in the classroom so yep yeah thats all thats why im doing it now okay lets see how i go ill let give you a report on friday or something i have one nxt question okay it probably wont be well its not one hopefully as part of the output itll be something like that is that correct so youve got the gaze position of the first person the second the most position of the first the most position of the second and i dont know how ill call them most action or something yeah is that just in sort of you mean you cant say that so itll be like in the monitor but yeah therell all be different tiers like that and then theres the language stuff as well yes because of what thats just the yeah this is the easy stuff yeah well eisenmeis eisenmeis and thats enough for you right i mean thats just the way you want it hopefully thats of course a lot of things that can do that its the language parts that are part of the art part yeah so it was just checking i know the language parts they say ill tell you this would be the yeah thats the new part thats interesting do you know what the the sets of codes are well whatever youre getting out of the jazz analyzer so yeah whatever that is blinks as well right yes im not sure we need to know exactly where they are just how many there are so you dont want to part of the stage i dont know i suppose it could go i think you should well theres two views on this if you do then the people formula letting research questions will ask about them right but if you dont theyll probably ask about them anyway and then youll have to add a amount of the fact well thats really easier just to shove them in you can stick them in a different track and then load them or not load them as you please because its not well i dont know is it part of so these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time right isnt blink a part of this blink would at the moment just get lped in with the previous keys yeah but isnt that important because when theyre blinking basically its like a nail code you cant find out what theyre doing otherwise so it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that youre doing so it could be that if only they hadnt had a blink just then they would have been i dont know what yes moving somewhere else or its more likely to be blinking and seeing whos the other person is doing something but you want to know that not too much relies on missing stuff because people blink i was thinking more like you know the person looks at a part and theyve got a fixation before and after and theyre blinking in the middle and you know there may be times when you want to treat that as one thing yes normally we just this is a add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation oh right okay because youre not absorbing any new information thats what the critical sort of deciding factor is right in that case then these tears are already like blink corrected yes then you wouldnt have blinks as part of this youd want blinks as a separator if youre going to have it it would be as separate to your where just the mark yeah yeah a chalk position the key thing here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive and the second key thing is it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes whats included in this case yeah whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that because you know it wouldnt necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes no not certainly not looking at codes yeah i suppose if you know that eye track is the meal just snow i know what to look for and what not to does that mean you need to blink correct for the analysis then i think using it comes out of the eye track already right theyre already blink corrected well theyre already identified as blinks then its it is what stage i think the software that ive used the pools the blinks so ill add it on im not sure what right so thats the software that comes with the eye track the end of the software that comes with the eye track yeah so its certainly listed as a separate event in the stream blinks are a tag from the edf and thats everything its registered is it okay if you want the blinks to merge into a fixation in my worth making that part of the requirement for the edf stuff its up to remind me to just add that analysis to it i mean this isnt after they just check the times of time yeah i mean if it wont because of the fixation itll be down to what we define as a gaze so basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it and so if they blinked a lot within that theyre still looking at an object so its just the time in to the time out right but what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye track is offered does that and whether that gets through so that craig gets it automatically in what hes translating to gdf whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker or whether we even like it right and want to do it some different way yeah i think we ask you for that as it stands does contain the blinker information yes because im sure thats a pedant in the docentation ive read through yeah theres a blinker but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus theres blinker information possibly you know it teaches us a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are because as i was saying they like to use blinkeraders measures to cognitive difficulties right okay yeah so im not my worth i started looking at that and just seeing what date is already in the se format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis ive got to do an analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway so yeah i dont think check the blinks during that isnt going to be a big problem it should just be a matter of treating it on the point to the last fixation or something yeah so if theyre not still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink then why is that the right thing to do analytically well the real reason is as long as theyve been blinking even if theyre in open range somewhere else thats when they start absorbing the information oh right yeah you said that its basically like its a long secade kind of a facial suppression when you move and its the scene when youre blinking youre not taking anything in well but does the duration of fixations count for anything if youre just adding the link to the fixation youre not treating it as a secade its that yes thats for this sort of geys time measure its not actually the fixations are still independent so the fixation duration doesnt include the blink in the ascii yet its only when we start looking at sort of the total geys the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing okay i cant get this yeah yeah viewing time right so more complicated than i thought yeah ive forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object yeah okay its as the area youre looking for a final thing that just says between this time and this time youre looking at this object between this time and this time youre not looking at anything yeah although we also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have youve got a measure of the average fixation duration again just to see if its been longer just more stable move that i fixation or not yeah yeah i think at the moment the gdf one has fixations in it so i guess that would be part of the gdf2nxt transformation to fixations into gases and whatever else yeah okay okay dont worry about that just the moment okay i mean this is kind of what we were talking about before this confusion about whats in the gdf i mean you might see it as the initial gdf is just whatever straightforwardly translates without you know without transforms with just the data format changing from the ascii and then theres a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in augmented gdf format like this blink and the gaze and whatever else and then you translate to nxt you might still want to have everything in this one gdf file format that represents everything and then the nxt thing is just a splitter its not doing any fancy analysis right so i see this as you know a bunch of little routines that take the gdf without this information in it and add new information into it and then the gdf file that contains these postprocess analysis well thats partly why i brought this up now im not sure at what point in the data path things sort of happen but thats what i want to end right yeah so will you actually be doing much of the gdf or are you expecting the most in ascii at the nxt so when youre actually doing your results well the nxt stuff will have the more complete picture because it will include combining all the linguistics with all the movements and the actions right but therell be i suppose just some purely im im meant to stuff we could do presably for gdf yeah yeah you told me earlier because you could do a quick analysis on the gdf stuff that happened before you did the dialogal analysis stuff so you can get some results anyway cant you yeah i mean it doesnt matter which data format its in nxt or gdf but it makes more sense for the converter between gdf and nxt not to add any data all it does is do this stupid data format conversion and its just you know separating it out into little steps so you know there have to be these other scripts that add any data transforms that data format transforms but data transforms like this idea of putting together gazes from fixations so you know if we keep it simpler like that so that its in little pieces then itll be just easier to understand what the whole thing does right okay because you know if suddenly you discover theres a problem with the gdf to nxt transform you want to know whether its one of these little post processes going wrong or whether its just the thing that dps it into the multiple files for the and gdf to nxt transform is pretty simple so right and thats also why i sent you the subrukin software that takes the ascii format originally and then just oh yeah yeah the german stuff yeah yeah yeah the german stuff because that little utility does things like well you can tell it to what to do with blinks whether just the lp of the data or not what the minim fixation duration per stable fixation would be so if it picks up fixations less than say 50 milliseconds you can tell it just to again lp them all together thats not a reliable enough fixation but you can put in these sort of things so thats a bit of software sent and that includes the subrukin things as well so ill tell you a little bit of what were going to do with that source code and that restriction on that so thats like all the analysis that you need to do to things are you just going to copy what they do or is it docented like why they did it the way they did it or is it just no theres very little docentation theres like a bunch of police or things whats good starting point right so itd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions they made about how to do things yeah i suppose i can easily look through it and start writing out some docentation on it and then ill get that going sort of starting point for us to talk about today for what analysis we need to actually do on it yeah crazy yeah great idea switches on whatever else you need to do okay good okay yeah so one to one yeah well one to one one to one yeah well one to one one to one a bit more of a look at this gds stuff then start looking through that start looking through that and make sure that that works and then ill just say there are a lot of strange vintage tags that the i link produces that are fairly meaningless and its strips say a lot the junk yeah yeah that yeah and that no that the the the jess analyzing those quite a few things as well well we dont want to build it into our data path we just want to learn from it i think right correct right thank you possibly but the things that use it that are useful for generating this gds stuff i can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into jess analyzer when im doing the gds stuff im just thinking you know lucky so this takes the asking to simplify the asking and simplified in with transforms in it asking and its just it seems to me harder to maintain something thats got that in it it would be better to break things up into like steps and ill well why do i think this i dont know because its somebody elses program and then theyre going to give us the next version and thats going to break our entire line yes you know thats the main reason yeah yeah i mean well you know lets say what well well well playing to do with it then lets take that lets take this off to find out what functions are useful for us in that and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the xml file i can imagine that also requiring some discussion about what they do is what we actually want to do that should be interesting yeah yeah but first part of that will be docenting what theyve got and then discussing it with robin well its not going to be quite grabable because its written in java right but yeah well ill try to motion mostly here ill show you almost the logic is going to be yeah well yeah and if in doubt dont filter stuff out keep it in right because we always dp it to this other nxt track that we dont need to load necessarily right the idea is you just keep stuff from us yeah its always better than making too much compression to start with and then you know im able to go back yeah so some of those xml nxt will handle it will it oh yeah its easy enough to dp stuff into a separate track yeah we got to teach you about this at some point though so still not quite sure when it sounds like maybe in another week okay okay jonathan maybe you promised that to tell you about it when you first arrived youre going to get overload about looking at our tracks you leave very quickly its just too many things at once and it was an important that it be then yeah well ive got to hire you all the stuff over here and been going through yeah it looks like its coming to the end of the stuff the stuff is listed there already im going to start looking at that as an xray hes a cool customer hes ready for it okay i think were done right yep oh i my peaches blank still sorry oh yeah i dont know i dont really need to this just says look at the wiki find out whats next you could give craig more work to do this ones fine i might be having to check out these batteries and things wont i oh yeah well take that well well do it with the trains as bad as today i dont know if craig was just praising that set okay oh yeah were going to have to do the data state to just try the data i dont know if its going to be good i dont know if its going to be good i think thats the thing i think thats the thing i think thats the thing yeah well i dont know if its going to be good i said oh yeah but i would tell you to go off your set okay thank you you

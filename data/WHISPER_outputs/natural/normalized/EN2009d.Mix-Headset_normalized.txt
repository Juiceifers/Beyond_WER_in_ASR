which data man you know yeah i want everything and then ill decide what i want so this was that facetoface meeting okay but it doesnt there isnt so there are things in the abstract record that we definitely dont want in the gdf format like the frame rate eye movement you know were expecting the gdf format to be sort of a parsed version of events and you know theres just too much raw frame rate stuff coming out of this you wouldnt want it in this kind of format for a translation data thing yeah we always get that through were not throwing anything away were not throwing anything away we just decide to rejig this at some finer method well still have the original end a method of filtering but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyze against the other tracks of data so the data that we want to compare with the language or with whatever so as long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalized to a finer take because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that youve done huge amounts of analysis and you actually had the data you threw it away because you treated it so grossly yeah okay so in essence whatever we should be able to backtrack and say okay instead of every second every tenth of second or some such thing well were not doing frame rate at any frame for well maybe we are i dont know i had thought we were yeah the eye tracker does right well the kinds of events that we had before talked about putting into the record but then yusin alana and nxt isnt based on saying every ex seconds something give me whats happening every ex seconds its more like give me the fixations and what needs to know the duration of these things right yeah duration would be able to say is the difference between saying that something is in a particular state every frame whatever the frame rate is ten seconds a minute thats one kind of way of looking at data and a parsed version of the data which isnt at any particular length it relies on this really close frame rate well so theres the real time theres only events what im trying to figure out is whether weve thrown time away no no the time is still in there but what you want is to figure out what are the what are the concepts behind that data that you want represented so rather than saying the eye was at this particular place here and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here you say there was a fixation from this time to that time and that was blank from this time to that time okay so one of the formats in which i track your data is analyzed is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event okay so you actually have to be have to show at some time slice rate where the eye was on the same target as the other guy a similar target what wed both been dealing with so we have to we have all the parts the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time all right now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate but i think thats really unlucky but my point is that we mustnt throw away or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data so the two issues here were not throwing anything away but the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data would you be so the more you can plan typically the eye will move right so over any one second the eye is actually fixing on a bunch of different things and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here whats going to happen is that if you use the real frame rate its going to jiggle all over the place its going to be on this landmark its on this object that object this fixed thing that fixed thing okay youre going to get lots and lots of stuff and its percentage distribution that youre going to want its not i went here you know its like person walking i went here i stayed here its more like fly hovering so you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation because if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events yeah but the sort of start and end times will give you that say that as a and then you just measure against you know against big friends yeah the cumulative total timer okay so the percentage is its not something youre using for measurement its a cut off for whether or not it counts as a fixation well thats the thats the problem there are two ways of doing it one is that theres always a cut off right but the other is that there will be a time span a kind of reaction to some event span yes ill lag in some of it i suppose theres the secadic movement itself and so i mean there are really two ways of looking at this one would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing okay and one would like to know sequences of they didnt look at the same thing and then they broke it or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didnt break you know one one could imagine those two categories thats thats a kind of testing of our hypotheses but theres a certain amount of um dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published and one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event right one percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking and one percentage of time over some you know reasonable time span of a couple of seconds right so theyll be theyll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places so we have to be able to deliver those two things and theyre rather different demands right the the should still all come at the little sketch i asked this for last week about nxt and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other in their mouse movements and things yeah that should because all you want to know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after but because its also based on the the time course of the procedure youll be able to basically get a scan path at the pattern of events from that okay can we try it to make sure that that um that this is satisfying elements i did have it somewhere i didnt have it well theres a whiteboard right we love this thing see if the pens work so um this is um as eyes right and bs eyes and i think what youre saying you should probably draw this right is that they you know if um from this time to this time theyre looking at triangle one what youre saying is that you want to know in the critical you want to know after theyre theyre looking at triangle one whats happening in this period with the sky right or how lets lets imagine a typical construction event okay theres some part there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use right there may be or not a construction already begun and somebody makes the first move theres some kind of communication either gestural imaginary or verbal that plans how were going to do it before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning while theyre speaking or communicating in some way the other person may or may not be looking where theyre looking okay they may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest lets call it the construct existing construct which could be zero right or the the addendum the thing which is next going to be added next piece okay now in neither case when you draw this hes looking at triangle one which youre actually drawing you know for the period of time in which hes steadily looking at triangle one is going to be very very short right because staring fixively without interruption blink or or saccade is is in extremely short event at that point the lumped all the individual fixations as long as it doesnt move off that triangle together is a twototal sense gaze so its in a region its in a region thats a target maybe okay but even so youre likely to get bouncing in and out of the region right so even so you want to look at if were interested in how long before the construction move takes place how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing lets call that our measure of alignment so theyre going to be yeah thats right a is going to be on triangle one and various other places thats right and b okay and were going to look at the percentage of that time where theyre both in the same region right so what i want to make sure is that we dont simplify do you know what i mean temporally simplify too much so that yeah i mean as long as were because then you lose percentages yeah there shouldnt be anything to see right and so b has some periods of looking at one and all which will also be intermittent because yeah so you know he might get triangle one there and now maybe this ones going to overlap quite a bit yeah so what you want to do is be able to define bigger periods which is the period when theyre sort of interested in triangle one overall right this is sort of when they should be when they should be if we have an event at that yeah the second like name for the second before it and then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it yeah but thats that should okay thats not something that you can do in the nxt query language but you cant do that in any you know this is such a special purpose but its easy enough given the data format for any of these things to do that so you could do it on because its just a matter of the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is an event that you want to pull out because you know algorithmically youre already putting together i mean this is essentially already you know these fixations with stuff in between and you know weve got an algorithm for deciding one thats a look i guess you already have that or no well its just based on a stable fixation for sure or something crossing into that region oh yeah yeah so its all fixations these are all fixations and cots but within the yeah so thats easy enough so the hard thing is they could be moving their ir betrayally here right and you know maybe even having fixations on other things yes yes yes because for example for part of that time both b and a are probably looking at the construct okay if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed you would tend to look that forward yep so this is able to yeah but what you need to do is we can already build into this gdf format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is but i think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in some tool and play around with the definitions because you wont get it right the first time yeah sure so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events and it allows a reasonable choice for that right what you need is something well no because you need to you need to be able to see the effects of this so i guess this is a case of craig writing some scripts so robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying you know add this data automatically i mean its not that hard right its just therell be a bunch of these youll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and whether the other object is the existing construction or not right right so essentially this this a e is divided into tr1 and c and other stuff okay where c is the construct of the existing thing right so if they if they they had a fixation on c you wouldnt be worried but if they had a fixation on c we take a separate wed look at the percentage time i mean i have no idea because i dont know how people look when theyre building things together okay so theres a theres the addendum and the and the the existing construct and i dont know whether theyre going to spend more time looking at one or the other but if theyre whatever it is that one is looking at it the others looking the same place theyre in good shape but you know theyre going to look at the clock yeah sure im not going to look at it and thats what the other stuff is were not going to look at it thats what the diagonal stripes are for thats true but we can one of the things well be doing is categorizing people i take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock we expect that we put people under time pressure theyll look at the clock a lot more but thats like a separate analysis right sure its a separate analysis but you dont want to throw it away right so so every step if all of these things are actually categorized by the eye tracker as to where the eye is right you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say all right for this phase its tr1 or c for this phase its its q1 or c but what we find what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level right and then its a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want so this is one we hadnt thought of adding before but we should right which is well how would you decide whether something was the current addendum that you have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film for the moment so thats a human decision yeah absolutely yeah yeah so so i mean once youve got that some information you do well youve got the gdf format you then filter it to say right between time x and time y theyre theyre constructing it theyre adding triangle 1 to the construct and then you just say in that time period what essentially theyre looking at triangle 1 what essentially theyre looking at the construct so thats thats thats thats thats thats thats thats the addendum and the construct should be you know kind of yeah they they change their true identity but theyre theyre categories of stuff now i yeah kind of assumption was that that this was jp land that thats what he was what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence okay so and the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well they were several candidates for the addendum all right and and it was the negotiation of which candidate was going to be the right candidate its actually the interesting stuff so i should talk to him about this hes hes actually but we emailed me with a list of things he wants to discuss at length so but we we jp to be defining that maybe well this is my question for him is he going to define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out or see so i mean you know theyve been working on construction there for a while so maybe that they have a coding system thats ready to go and we should just apply it yeah okay okay they do a lot of subassembly the tasks theyve been doing so they may well have a i could believe them you know taking an interest in that well thats fine i mean the general division was language here and other stuff there right right so i would just do that right what well we have ill just add it back i mean actions might mostly be theirs right but since we have the the eye tracker were going to have to answer their questions oh yeah eye tracker here yeah i mean we know that but so theyll theyll tell us something about that but presumably what youd piously hope is happens here is what happened with transactions right that the verbal analysis and the and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points the same chunking points well yeah but i mean with transaction coding on some like this you would use you wouldnt consider it verbal analysis exactly itd be verbal plus action because i mean but its a task breakdown its just a set it is a task breakdown but for the verbal version there are ways of announcing that now were doing a new one right yeah but you wouldnt have you wouldnt do two coatings for task level one no you wouldnt have to transaction code in that one of the things one of the things youd like to establish you know as an as an outcome of this is that you could analyze either end and youd get the same chunking of the material i dont think thats real estate because i think what youd do is you know youd get the same chunk what youd actually do is use the full record of what you have and do a segmentation i think itd be hard to understand what was going on if you use like just the language without which in the video to decide whether were breaking down the task its a hypothesis oh you dont want it to be coding based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things well the language events are multimodal right you know theyre doing all these things together they are doing these things together but one of the things that you one could imagine doing is you know having the transcription there and just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates why do you care whether they stop stuff they can do it just based on the language because essentially youre looking at cycling sequences and discourse and if the discourse tells you whats going on thats information i mean one of the questions is how the information is going to be shared across these media and if you can get it all out of the speech you know if all of the chunking is available when there is speech okay then its carrying a lot of the burden well it seems to me thats more important than the other things one could get out of this data but you know but this is but its possible we havent looked at data like this with this with our old fashioned analyses you know and it would be really nice to know that much information that chunking of the task information is being carried by the language because jps question the overriding question is so whats language for you know people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues dont even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when theyre doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant because language is irrelevant it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where were controlling whether you have language or not you can get the entire chunking of the task kind of the language yeah well i can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both its more i cant quite see why its important to know that they can do it just based on the language when you know that they have both because you know its a selfcontained system as opposed to a system which cant be interpreted without the other system uhhuh well i think that was just about to fail that was just about to fail almost all studies on language claim that language is a selfcontained system which will give you everything you need to know really thats the claim okay anyway i didnt say it was true thats the claim and so its worth testing so back to this main problem which is you know the record that we are getting in the first instance is about these you know theyre looking at some region of the screen to find dynamically and then we need some way of knowing what the you can see adding these other analyses about you know theyre jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out whats percentage of time theyre looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the alon track or nxt theyre both sort of track based in this way but the hard part is knowing how you want to do that and i think in the first instance what were trying to get into the gdf one that is just this and then weve got no option but to figure out a way for like to look at this just explore this data suggest ways about doing it and be able to play them back and see when we think weve got these things right i dont think we even know what the set of these things are that we want much less how to get out of it and we will then establishing the full set you know take us much of the project so yeah thats right so this is not you know this is something were aiming for but this isnt something that affects what craigs programs for the initial gdf translation my only concern as i said when i barged in was just to make sure that we didnt lose the things that we might need to pick up later so lets just return to this question of frame rate because this is the thing we were not planning to transfer into this format so again you know a frame rate kind of coding is can again be seen as a track but it says everythings coding like this right where you say its state a state b state c but since the definitions of look a thing were looking at are the ones which get rid of the lower level like chiggling around in the area of a particular object right so if were moving the green triangle weve defined a region which is dynamically the green triangle wherever it is we will jiggle around in there but it doesnt matter where we are in there thats right but these are level of analysis youre happy that its not going to have frame rate like this its going to have an interpretation like this well that interpretation is definable to frame rate by the only way were going to use frame rate what does that mean sorry well i mean because i can say for how many frames this fixation went is officially defined so as long as its not an untimed event okay yeah all events have a start time under the entire time so its fine i can say its a long one or its a short one or its 20 milliseconds more than that one it seems to me that alans concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because this thing in itself is a bunch of fixations with the cards so things like fixation the number of fixations fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover you might want yeah theres some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well because having long steady fixations can be informative and so can i have a fixation as percentage of it this isnt a leading question this is a question question why would that be informative particularly if theyre holding there if theres less dancing around the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part so there is a difference between if they even though theyre still looking at the same part if theyre looking around it and rather than just holding their gaze steady or on it so you think that for example if theyre looking at one or another apex of triangle it would just make a difference yeah and were exploring the thing as opposed to they were simply all right there is there it is so that really means that were not throwing away absolute fixations no i wouldnt they have to throw away screen location with absolute fixations but the actual look no no this is still summary data were talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one right so its possible exactly so i understood you to mean exploring the figure because you know your fixation is point and the figures are bigger than points so you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it well yes but that probably isnt going to be easy to get okay because they have to break up the parts so you just want to know the variability of the fixation i wouldnt that differ from person to person yes it can do but its also looking at it within their own behavior okay so its the number of different spots within that region where the i as fix i would say just the number of fixations the number of different so the spots will be different anyway so its too high youre not going to have the same pixel so we have the option that we can put in an a fixation thing here right well if you want the smaller coding in here so that its not just parsed into this idea of which object but you also have the raw fixation data we can put that in as another track if you think that thats something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other well all i understood you to ask for was the duration yeah thats all he asked for yeah well i think weve got everything then as well as its you can come back you can always yes its youre not throwing anything away then yeah and in nxt theres no cost right because the you just dont choose to load those right all were doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to you know so if the things that you just know are crazy and youre not going to want then we dont do it but otherwise we go ahead and dump them because its easy to dump up the fixations yes so its a number of different okay so its the number of fixations well actually do you have the average duration do you want the other ones did you want the other ones but duration times will somehow whether its the average one or duration of each fixation in the region not eat well if its each you have to break it down into another tier right you cant you can say there were three fixations and they averaged a certain time but you dont want to the average should be all right to work well what about the overall sum of the durations is that i mean which way do you want it its not the number of fixations in the average time yeah but thats the way you want it that way around yeah so thats a measure of jiggle in the region roughly and did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number you can have as many of these as you should be able to derive that presumably from well its not the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high so you know it saves you having to do right scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are numbers that are going to be useful to you whats our error of measurement on location on the screen so to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes little circles are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region it can vary a bit depending on the calibration but were building in a sort of error margin wed be some pixels around but therell also be a minimum one because im trying to think its probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small itll need a slightly larger just because its yeah okay so a larger area of error margin around it okay so my question is going to be the mouse is a dynamic object right the eye track is a dynamic object or is it only the piece that the other persons eye track is on thats an object in this definition no the other persons gaze position is an object okay with some with plus or minus something or other yeah around it some circular area and so you can be on the object but not on the other persons gaze so there can be a triangle which has so if there is gaze in the center and your gaze actually happens to be here yes youre in the triangle region but not looking at their individual but they probably will avoid looking directly if theyre looking directly at it its obscuring the part but its directly at it when when these two in this situation when these two overlap right like this yeah yeah something about thats going to cut that because the program weve got there is just in it theyre only looking at one thing at a time so whether its triangle or whatever else so what youre just saying is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a nice point and maybe an eye at the same time well it would come up it would say yes right i mean because they would be in the same place so if you youre going to have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition if the mouse is on the construct the main thing is the trees and then the trees yeah well those are different tracks of information so what you want is one track of information about which object its on what about whether or not its something other guys gaze and what about whether its on one of the mouse we treat those as other objects but the difference between them and the parts of the thing to be constructed is that theyre allowed to overlap with other things nothing breaks okay yeah but in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information because they can be looking at they could look simultaneously at somebodys mouse somebodys gaze and some object right yes as opposed to simply looking at somebodys gaze when the mouse isnt also there right and you want to know those things so these are independent right so theyre independent dynamic objects so what we want is whether theyre looking at the other persons gaze right and say they are in this period well i mean its okay so a definition of were all looking at and touching the same thing so imagine that weve just added a piece to the construct all right so now thats the construct and both mouse symbols are on it right and both gazes are on it yep right so at that point you should have a lineup of a is on the construct a is on the mouse a is on a is on a is mouse a is on b is mouse a is on b is on bs gaze and b likewise yeah okay so theres a lot of tracks here right because we just did a this fixation track and then theres as mouse not their eyes is on an object right and the mouse might be on it yeah but the mouse is also triangle one dynamic object but it doesnt matter thats fine okay the mouse which thing where is the mouse you know its on this object and as eye is on well as mouse i guess right as eye might be looking at as mouse here as eye might be looking at bs mouse here right i mean these are all the different ways of taking cross products and the things that could be collocated so you just treat them as independent and then you look for combinations of them yeah im guessing from what youre saying you want all these tracks i think we need to yeah well just find a measure of the line and looking where the other guy is directing attention and there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track one is where the mouse is yeah the other is where the gase is so you kind of got the idea here yeah yeah yeah so yeah so its just a matter of adding the two mice pointers and the two gase as extra objects so yeah some of the songs ive got an id in there we can just say right at this between these times theyre looking at that object or the look of the mouse the look of whatever but the important thing is you dont treat the entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive its just so that the object is like a separate level of analysis its what if it were going to be objects then whether theyre looking at the gase but its also going to be the case that whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square okay what do we do about that does that happen yeah because if you have them close together theres always some fuzz factor around there and so if theyre left lying close together or in fact in the model in the not in the model in the supplies set theyre actually neatly packed into a little space okay so what youre saying is like a new problem for us which is so if your objects close together your i gase can actually be looking at the left edge one and the right edge of the other theyre looking at two objects at once yeah so youre saying sweet sweet okay can you write on my pen pad just to say yeah pens whiteboard pens so youre saying you know they could be looking at square one at this point because they because the two are so close together that their regions overlap okay thats a problem for the data models and either the things that were using but unless we just define it as theres only that they are exclusive and whichever area has a greases overlap is what theyre actually looking at what do you mean by greatest overlap with one if youve got your sort of eye position and its its unlikely to be exactly 50 or one object 50 in the other draw it my special reasoning is no good i think i think its seeing information im the one that uses the whiteboard because i actually put the microphone yeah what im im thinking is if youve got see one object there and you know so this is the better pen okay part one and part two and youve got their sort of theyre looking there uhhuh then that overlap means theyre looking at two pieces simultaneously yeah but you had a way of choosing which one right yeah and thats the idea is more of it it may be a bad idea you just throw it in a day yeah thats a decision well the thing is that im saying is if theyre looking at most of what their overlap is here then we stick with that one so you just mean which is it closer to the is the circle and what is the circle theyre looking at pixel or something right no that because the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area it wouldnt just be a pixel it will be an actual like a circle and the area the gaze will wobble so thats thats going to be its so thats very a size its a sort of lump target so therell be a bit of a some sort of overlap two objects or indeed they might be looking from one to another yeah theyre yeah its just like you want to choose or thinking so you dont want to decide its only one the only thing is the only gds for its working at the moment its actually got separate track for each part okay well thats fine that i was going to say thats the obviously oh but what yeah thats going to be analytically because its going to is he has to know how many parts of it well it depends on what you build and theres different parts of the different parts whether you do in the tangram way theyre playing or whatever six to a dozen okay the thing is if weve got to see the track i know ways of getting around the track we can easily analyze it down play it wrong i mean i think its very likely that i mean if the other oscillating thought then thats presumably going to change the week so you are actually going to see them flipping between well not as the regions overlap if theyre really close to the region its going to get fixed yeah and if you define the regions so neatly that theres you know that were losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when its in the middle of space then i mean i actually like the solution however ugly it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every yeah well the data format im worried about its the way you do the analysis because you dont want to have to say you know did they jointly look at triangle one okay did they jointly look at square one okay did they jointly look at you know you need some way of going over the whole thing but we can find ways around that i think for now we do it this way and then we think about what we need out of it in the end its just you know in a lawn that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalist way of up translating to a lawn there will be a zillion tracks and itll probably ruin their viewer because youll get very sparse data on each track itll be like the old referring expression generals visualization in the map task you know when they talk about one object one landmark and then another one that was brilliant well its big right yeah it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see whats going on but because you very clear picture whats going on well well see if a lawn likes it or not yeah well okay so we better do a test one and we better also like have in the representational list of parts like even in the nxt of translational list of parts yeah it affects the way we do the nxt yeah but theres only list parts in the gdf so yeah thats not a problem theres a base basically well theres three places where youve got the id there so youve got an id for a part you can id for a location on the screen such as the target config the clock whatever else and then we can easily add ids for the two most points and the two gazes and from that and basically all the tracks are doing is saying at this between this time theres a look at this object yeah this id so lets say its effectively a track for each id okay so what about the point where a part becomes the construct you still identify it as part yeah but what should lose that well what happens there is that the two the existing parts basically cease to exist right and a new part with a new id starts existing at the point where theyre joining so every time a part is added to the construct it becomes a new part so the construct actually has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing okay so if theres just the initial thing you put in the middle of the screen thats just the initial object yeah as soon as you put a part theres construct but its construct one because when you add another part construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two yeah right so actually defining all of those as the construct is going to be the trickiest thing its also going to be a problem because youre going to have one part to construct forming in the middle of a fixation right so its not going to be quite as clear right so youre looking at trying the one right and then it becomes a success and it becomes constructors simply whatever and there could be more than one construct at a time right there is no thought construct and then you can start again you can build sub subsamely with that you can link the stuff in but why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it because the yeah thats whats always working the moment because its generating any id when you try to new part oh and this is because we dont want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct its not a construct at all its just a one thing and we dont want to triangle one to suddenly have yeah well the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence so do we know the difference between we broke it and it went away and its now part of the construct yeah theres joint events so if a joint event if theres joint event linked to the item then you know its become part of a construct or can we tag the constructs with whats in them yeah the constructs were already tagged with it so theres actually a subpar of the data format which says freeze construct which two parts made that okay so we could essentially well then we could cumulative or it is a new construct because it has a new list of parts yeah but you can still track what parts went into it right so you can still find triangle one whatever some fancy programming is going to have to be done to say i was looking at triangle one and im looking at triangle one in construct one yeah because the first construct was triangle one in square one yeah but thats easy to me because the each construct has the ideas for the things that construct it so now we have to ask whether so lets imagine this weve made a construct of two parts and were triangle in a square and were considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isnt attached to the triangle okay are we looking at the square are we looking at the construct yeah that was the next question i had yeah youll be looking at construct because thats not it in this definition youll be looking at the construct yeah there isnt a way to figure out that youre looking at the square rather than the triangle well well be looking at yeah well be looking at the last thing is that we have the echo the echo traces from the ascii format so if you want to be able to say im looking at the square instead of im looking at the construct its possible to get that data out it is yeah its not doing it in the draft challenge at the moment but i can easily add it to give that information if you want okay because thats the example presumably thats the best example of overlapping areas because if the thing the two things are now about it of course theres an area which is kind of a compromise to them okay so what im trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between something going out of existence because its joined a construct something going out of existence because we threw it away suppose we pick up we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away we decided we didnt like it and we took another one is it triangle one is it triangle one prime or something like that its the replacement for triangle one yeah if you create a new part it gets a new id so if you drag a new part out its a bit well do i know what it replaces you dont because youd have to have human coding to do that youd have multiple triangles that you broke and you want to know which one theyre planning on using it for this is true but if i have triangles one two three right and i throw them away any triangles i take out are two place one two three well you know which mold they come from and so you know which shape they match but you cant possibly know which one of the ones theyre meant to replace yeah i mean you dont you dont know which one theyre meant to replace but you know theyre not meant to replace you can either have them thrown away they cant replace the new parts only appear when the previous ones broken right so the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen and if theres no one tr1 track the tr1 track is gone oh so theres no two parts with the same shape oh there are many were same shape but not the same shape in color same identity oh the same shape in color right okay oh is that true youve decided not to make all the triangles really square thats what theyre at the moment okay so you cant tell what is meant to replace them because its the same its just in case of the mold right yes thats the way it works at the moment i assume thats how 9mg had set it up okay so thats back to so there tims yep so shape plus color they are individual theyre unique yeah all the parts are unique so were hang on that makes the task a little bit easier yes right 10g a much easier one you can see all the lines so it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle indeed which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier doesnt it yeah but this also thats hard to code i mean thats really a thing we might do okay so now lets make sure that the coding would survive that its just its a beautifully controlled situation the construction task is essentially the same its the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple for just to choose a color at random here yes i think the ending is probably the same the two triangles isnt there theres two identical triangles in the tangram yes at the moment there are two small ones and two large triangles theyre actually the same physical size and shape at the moment theyre in different colors that also means in the new parts list theyre there for you know two large triangles and two small ones whereas in the revised edition if they were all just black theyd only be one more in the new parts when you specify these things do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on so is this hardwiredinthetims programmer is it just an artifact of the way we its hardwired yeah yeah when you specify the molds in the in the file that generates the parts weve got list of parts the molds are based just taken out of the file that generates the firstfirst parts right okay so so how many parts how many parts are in the file how many parts are in the file thats how many parts are purely in the parts box but if you have five black triangles theyre going to be five black triangles in the parts box or one if you have five black triangles theyre going to be five parts in the five black triangles than the parts box so line the words that you need for in the initial configuration you can reuse a triangle so if you only want one black triangle you used create one black triangle in the parts box and then reuse that black triangle five times in the configuration mmhmm as long as this is possible so i mean that just is a kind of thing which is so simple so much like a single yep same one zero variable change that it did but what would the written code be because im trying to map this onto baufix and baufix has multiple you know all the nuts are red or all the flat things what colors can have different nuts well the same part the same part is different colors oh yeah yeah but they dont have enough to make unique no i mean theres more than the multiple pieces are the same so why when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then therell be lots of them lying around i think thats how the robot is set up too five green bolts here is one i think weve got to the point where you know to try to summarize we think tims program can do both of these conditions that you want but im still worried about what the effects are for analysis because you were aiming at something in the gdf format and i wasnt quite sure what so all im doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that will miss by a simple view of for example regions and looking at triangle one yeah when its triangle one not triangle one anymore so okay so ill summarize what we said about that part every time you cast off a new part from a mold or you know every black triangle has a different idea and you know its a black triangle because you know which mold it came from yeah but you dont know which part it was intended to replace on the screen because you cant mind read its true so how can we define the shapes that people build what do you mean define well if assuming i was for a moment i was jp and i wanted to know how they actually went about building a thing okay and i wanted to look at the strategy and i wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever i mean i suppose i cant talk to you and im doing this task with you and i cant talk to you the thing which is going to be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you i can reach for the next thing and you can go where i reach but if i have some you know subgoal some long term subgoal of doing something clever with putting these together because its hard and putting these together because its hard its going to be almost impossible to convey that to you and the difference in the history of construction is an important thing and i wonder how we can get that information back i think that this is a human coding that is part of the action coding because i dont see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time why is not thats not the question im asking the question im asking is whats the history of the construct so you have the names of the things in there and you have two constructs suppose we have two sub constructs and whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier number of those constructs how do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct when the final construct the way the constructs are defined in the file youve got your parent construct and the parts that are constructed out of its parent child relationship the child can be a part or it can be none of the construct so construct two construct one is red triangle and green square construct two is two green squares construct three is a red triangle a green square and another red triangle i have looked at the construct four but thats okay because they all have different underlying part numbers and when you say what a construct in so how are we going to tell when for example you think were going to have to do human coding and when two sub constructs are put together no thats a definition where the construct has constructs as children yeah the join action the result what you need to a construction part two parts and whatever you take together construct youve got time when that happens you can see that construct appeared at that time and you can still track the children of that construct so we can zip through this and look at all the all the interactions in which people built subcontract constructs first which we expect them to do as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they dont okay and we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children yeah so we can easily look at things like that automatically its just the why they get new parts thats the problem for us we cant if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we dont know we cant know why until they do something with it if they we havent actually made a rule that you cant collect extra parts right extra parts dont appear so you cant collect them oh yeah you said that yeah there are there are its like grayed out there yeah but you can see the mold is there but they dont come filled no no i mean you have to break one to get one yes okay you can but you can break one when you break one you dont cast off the mold yourself it happens automatically yes oh okay never mind that it appears and then you like it so they just have to use it yeah the new part lights up sort of thing oh but they have to drag it ill pass the mold one yes you have to bring it to play and you cant just bring extras in case you know screw up you have to screw up first and then you can bring it yeah that is one thing unlike the see the bow fix or anything yeah there arent any extra parts and at the moment the software doesnt but it does have replacement yes replacement but no superfluous so you can have a standard stock of extra parts that will never use it okay so this why question doesnt even arise so you appreciate you appreciate the cost because you know what theyre going to do with it when they decide to move it past the mold line theyre doing something with it probably and youll know what theyre going to do with it because yeah but by the time both of them are doing that they must have already broken something so youll love what theyre replacing okay is there a way of telling the difference between intentional and intentional breakages how would you do that intentional hole in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts yeah its like the trash can idea they both put their hands on a construct because they dont like it yeah but thered be no way of cutting that automatically right how could you possibly do that you have to hope that theres language in one of them say something but thats a human coding right so that just doesnt be coded theres no way you could tell that just when theyre the role movement or something so not generically because if theyre going to do it by gesture theyll build up a convention so thats going to be a particular problem for jp right remember all the things were looking at are with language and without language and its going to be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language which means that they develop a convention suppose they start off with language and then they say yeah okay but this is probably part of the action coding sure so we just just want to make sure that we make a wish list right wish list as a side effect im trying to remember if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together they dont break they do if one persons dragging a part to a part that isnt that part thats just sitting on the screen theres not being touched they both break so the intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks for sure you know thats or well its not necessarily intentional they could just screw up yeah but they could discuss to set it a break something yeah i dont think thats very good no well never get away with that well get a bad score lets just throw that away and start again yeah wish we had fixed score problem have we oh yeah yeah it was through the rotation oh yeah percentage score yeah so rather than the number of panel please or some like no the score it was the percentage overlap and that made the score thats thats a weeks work the problem was to do with the no which which they had real to and absolute peace and its all to symmetry but thats not the fight it wasnt it wasnt a bug it was a dont tell me it was a feature no its them just forgetting to find something that had to be and the dutch lock yeah yeah which is probably a documentation fault its in the documentation but its like its quite a long page yeah of course its quite media problem not prominently flagged yeah exactly a communication flaw okay so we can thats now just lovely is there any crazy well one last thing is there anything else you want to tell us about the prior part of this which is the you know what else is holding you up from oh well yeah we should go back to the beginning the camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because in the old version it seemed to interfere with it uhhuh but when you when craig reconpiled it into this new version it seems to work fine yeah right so it doesnt slow down the eye tracker doesnt do anything nasty so we can tell so we pay for it theres very small graphical bugs but its not its not a big thing its like color white pixels in the course of it in the course of a cause of a task so its its nothing to distract nothing important nothing big enough theyre going to look at it right no all right so the last i think im sorry you know i had a sort of emails from you and i probably didnt catch everything the problem was that there are two temptation records yes they will now have to be two camtasia records because each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze they dont see their own gaze they see the other gaze yeah the other gaze so theyll need to be two safer camtasia videos yeah yeah oh do you need two copies of camtasia do you hopefully officially or the question is the release of camtasia where you just need one editing thing and two recording things because the recording the recording program is just quite a small program that just generates the video so i dont know if its having a look at the licensing for that just to see so youre going to look into this right yeah i hadnt thought about how to assume we just get one and one license could run a lot both of us was technically she had two well look at the license conditions it might not i suspect that it will be per machine i think i never prejudiced licenses in club rhythm okay ill have a look at the actual camtasia license the other thing we well and hold on before we get going further so this has implications for data storage right because weve got well no this is three times right because weve got oh no were going to build were going to use joes script to build the videos on the flight right because its fast so the permanent storage is just the camtasia stuff so is that a problem where are we putting things is there such a thing as a dual track video because you can certainly mix things what ideally one wants one doesnt really want to have these things because were using them for backup and for coding we dont really want to play them we can play them in fact and in fact wed almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel timealigned you can dump them into one video frame if you dont mind losing resolution but thats maybe a problem right well the other problem is camtasia has to be manually launched and both machines separate so the synchronization is going to be a problem yeah what are we doing for synchronization otherwise during the task theres a flash in a bleep oh i mean not during the task before before we yeah but youre not asking yes okay so that wed have to realign them we couldnt yes dump them from their start points well maybe you could the thing that youre dumping them onto just starts running with flash in the bleep you turn on the two copies whenever at different times but theres still no is the what are they i dont really understand the parts that are operating here camtasias are turning on there is no timestamp that comes from some common source no theyre on two separate machines and you start and end them separately theyre not talking to each other theyre just recording you start it recording it starts recording whats in one screen and you start the other recording on the other machine so and theyre theyre totally simply doing all the other ones these are backups right so the flash so the flash it allows you to hand synchronize them later if you need to by stripping extra video off the front as long as you make sure you start them before the flash then youre fine but theres a cost of having to go to backup which is synchronizing them so theyll include things like the itracer calibration yes which is not a bad thing actually because sometimes you want to go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject oh yeah see how long it took them actually thats true how long did it take them to calibrate yeah every time we calibrate it how many things things before the validation worked or something oh okay so you should start the camtasia really early right well yeah at the moment thats why i was assuming right okay no that actually saves you hours trying to make somebodys data smooth out when it wont because go back and actually yes they were crap thats a technical term technical categorization and psychological research um yes the other thing were getting sort of date was the microphones because only one of the camtasia videos will actually have the same track and thats because uh were just getting weve got one cable and two mics its supposed to be well we need sound recording right thats thats two track thats yes so at the moment its in what weve finally just at 12 oclock today looks like weve got it sussed is to get one channel one microphone for me in the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo uhhuh so a whole file uh unfortunately on what sorry on one machine on one of the the display pc the camtasia video its no or move the multimedia thats not what youre putting it i mean thats our only sound record yes well okay youve got the proper sound record but youre not dumping it through camtasia to record it right you yeah its camtasia thats recording what before we were going to use camtasia at all what what were we going to do what were we going to do with the sound uhhuh yeah so uh uh is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through camtasia rather than running it at straight no you got yeah you go exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anything else on the windows so you can you can decide whatever quality you want so okay so what youre planning on doing is bunging it on one of the camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the camtasia track its an easy bit of yeah and then youre going to bung it on the other camtasia track too if you need it right but well just were going to store all three separately then and the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the camtasia videos but youll know when the real experiment youll know the relationship between that and the itracker timings uh yeah because the the uh yeah because the synchronization the audio and visual synchronization comes at a specific point in the itracker file yeah no human intervention required its timestamped no its its stamped into it so its just after it prints the line starting experiment yeah im pretty sure its yeah but hold on do we need that i mean i thought the way that tim had this set up originally the audio the timestamps used there would be joint timestamps between the audio and the itracker so that you know the audio record 10 seconds in was the same as 10 seconds in the itracker record so that we didnt have to do any extra hand work you know any chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay so were relying on your matlab script to get us the chopped version of the audio right uh well the matlab script uh based just says yeah it gives you the time of the audio beep in this end signal right so we can either adjust the itracker track data or we can actually chop the audio signal yeah take off the first whatever 70 seconds theres going to be a way to sooner or later to align the itracker camtasia 1 camtasia 2 with two sound channels yeah yeah but uh but um lining up the camtasia 2 is going to take we hes working on a matlab script for the sound but not for so the one thats got the sound on it thatll also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up the one that doesnt have the sound on it it wont oh the beep will find oh so its just the bleeps oh okay so no way no hand for synchronization required at all as long as the scripts work right yeah thatll be basically the only thing thats going to be thats going to be the same thing okay how confident are you about the finding the script yeah okay how confident are you about the finding the script yeah thats the same thing yeah thats the same thing okay how confident are you about the finding these things break off the youve seen them it was yeah so we just have to hope we dont have any subjects with odd vocalizations yeah i dont see them with 10 hickaverts but you know they also tend to have a funny funny shape beeps so yeah okay yeah because this is the dropout test yep okay is there an in signal when you decide its all over does it yeah the signal at the start and the end of every trial right okay so when youve prest were finished yeah pings back at you yeah okay its just that all kinds of crazy things happen when youre saving a percentage of a trial sometimes a good you know being able to do that is sometimes a good idea okay oh yeah yes its a stereo jack its a stereo jack but its a mono microphone you got a solution for that then lining lets go through a line so its quieter because its not so its not powered but its still yeah we still pick up the signal you should theres not a better solution that involves yeah i think we do something better than that because you know people might want to use this first be sure to recognize something you never know the date is there yeah i mean its crazy ruin and anticoach which we specially build in anticoach yeah its on dead in the room which we specially build for this and youre going to want for a line we shouldnt screw it up more than we have to is there anything we can do to improve this oh no well no no better to collect it sort of with the powered microphone or something well when theyre out there they have batteries in them but its not theres a the thundering pad because of the lining out inputs so i thought a bit of solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket sound card so you said the problem was the the sound of the sound the sound of the sound of the stereo the input is mono right the jack that is plugged into is stereo but when its recording for microphone it records in mono so is that fixable like is there any way were in the sound third yeah and these are good i think the new sound card sounds a better solution than munching about with trying to filter white noise out oh i think well remember the old sound from the well the old sound from the 10th of well i suppose one thing you do is record the speech singleseparate for each person but then you have to pull the two sounds together which isnt hard but if each machine recorded we could record it like the so i think you have to align the videos anyway right yeah yeah put two on us and do a stereo signal yeah see easy im not a technical person if not if not if not if not if not if youre not if youre doing a matlab script you just read file one read file t and then so is there any reason why we dont do that yeah but then the matlab script will tell you how far apart there because you can just measure the drift between the two of them so you get a list of where the beeps are and then you say right this stream is like i dont know 025 seconds behind the other one says robin thinking about cutting and splicing yeah yeah well its in the old days we probably would have if theyd been in the same room we would have read a little stereo thing my background is back up as well just to make sure because its slightly dicey you know if his scripts dont work then dont get the old one i want to see one of them look really nice before we start running the subject do you want to do that it doesnt have to be a real trial it just has to be two guys talking in the two bits and then i just want to know it works the way you expect it to work this is not a gesture of mistrust this is just experience that if anything can screw up it will weve both been so badly picked in the past im trying to choose my language carefully because weve been recorded you hear more choice language at the point when weve all been a lot of work then we discover we cant use the session because of something we didnt think about yeah but this sounds reasonable to me so i think do you know if theyre bodysector things mmhmm do they both have the same sound card problem i wouldnt count on it do they both have the same sound card problem i wouldnt count on it they both got the same sound card okay so yeah its probably worth mentioning this to the guys in the garage in toronto right to save yes yeah so the external version has plugged that size uhhuh and that is stereo microphones right yeah the other ones like the smaller size and that isnt stereo so the card can do it its just that the connectors on the connectors are the back of the computer come well yeah i think tell the guys i think thats a if the documentation said it could record in stereo then i think we should talk to them about how theyve done this youre not sure from the documentation what it says it can do the bottom trouble is finding it the question is is it as much of what the size yeah yeah yeah but as far as we can tell when you find the website of the cravalize website and the review of it um and they werent entirely clear but they both suggested that it was a monomacrophone yeah i think its not the people i think you can put it into the other yeah its just the way theyre wired it so its getting late and ive got a two oclock and ive got a nice lunch so i want to eat my lunch today what did you want to get through today more i think i was useful going through your expectations about this because thats quite a bit clearer in my head at least yeah but i think mostly we leave you to go away and redesign the gdf and add new bits to the gdf along these lines yeah so basically the output gdf is just going to be a whole series of events yeah were starting in time and the events going to have whatever the object is thats been looked at and things and then yeah and then its a matter of we can put whatever filters we need after that so you can say right i just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly find out how much how percentage of time they were looking at it or whatever okay so given that there are these events recorded we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point for example there are also motions being recorded of objects yeah so youve got movements theres look events theres fixations of blinks in there at the moment as well and yeah and oh yeah and say yeah look say look say objects look whatever else but i think the thing to do is have a few to grow away and think about it this way with different tracks with different objects and the there are kinds of things weve added about whether theyre looking at the other persons gaze and what have you and try to change the specs so it reflects this and maybe maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something and the right thing to do is first to look at the spec the way you understand it now and some data and then alan will have new ideas about whats needed or about these postanalyses you know and then we can add them in but its going to emerge over time thats clear thats great i before we break up for lunch i just want to make sure that i know how long its going to be before we run mode okay so the sound thing is it stands in our way we need to be recording sound online okay so thats the thing that has to be solved the shape thing is solved yeah thats thats solved now we think yeah test we believe we have to test so thats that should be done this week in fact like tomorrow for example all the shape problems are solved generating shapes no problem scoring shape overlap no problem nothing is a problem there are no visual displays you dont have your models yeah they had their inspection last week jp staggered away from it so the moment you understand what you think is going to be like that so the moment you think that youre going to be like that yeah because i know youre going to trigger it yeah well anything you actually need fixed you know in that case joe doesnt live here anymore right well but he wasnt going to be booking any time to us after the 31st of october so that means that any bugs that need fixed in our corrects responsibility right you dont know how many change on that right thats what he said to us i need to discuss with him i would assume you know no more contact with joe its not fair to get work out of somebody for free so you know ask craig instead well hes physically here we want to pay him for some more time you can do that would that be a just better use of our time and get yeah well he wasnt paid in advance hes being paid in a rear so it doesnt matter i think he is around and i believe and if i think its better to have all the software i mean its not big things its just maintenance of this program at this point but if everybody has a lot to do and you know joe could give it a couple of hours which is what it might take just to fix it then lets do it because starting run time is not going to be yeah if you can give it you know like because the problem is youve got to have it immediately when you discover bugging that and we can make craig shift all his other priorities to do this because we bought him right but we cant we cant make joe do this yeah so its kind of between availability and speed from start to finish given that this is somebody elses code but it sounds like you dont think theres anything that actually needs fixed at the moment because we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something right we got what were building models right how many models do you need to completion and how long does that take and you got well and you know about complexity youre waiting on malice you can cold call her today is after me yeah i think so i have to check back with with jp fairly soon ok he wanted to the next 18 month plan great deliverables great progress with the experiment well thats what were doing now ok so what do we think if you have a fairly hectic week are we looking for subjects next week i think ok adds go up yeah i do i do but i think ad should probably go up this week we want people for next week is that ok is anybody now terrified at the thought that were live next week there are people coming in here one after another or two after two more likely ok is this generalized generalized anxiety robin or do you have a specific thing that ok so aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live so we want to do some piloting at the end of the week yep yeah so well get well get the audio stuff tested for single mic friends yeah get that test in a little basement i assume thats something you need me for in terms of that right oh yeah but shes actually relaxed that somewhat ok yeah ostensibly book time which isnt so you can dash in there for half an hour at a time does it sound very useful for you ok well ok we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway right and except by permission of us all right we own it so we can change that and everybody acknowledged the other week that we that we have but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your one accession is your ball yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dont worry theres a booking system right so its public whats booked in one of these i thought that was the problem that your mornings werent sliced off on a booking system maybe you should get on the book mornings as far as the i can see does you know if youre sat told use the booking system well we think we spoke to all the people who use those facilities the other day but we could be wrong yeah and one of the people upstairs downstairs have you know as rules about who you hand the keys to well because you know we like people to know to ground the oh i thought the lending for the book system caroline from caroline or the general office see because youre supposed to have training in but no they need they need an account on this machine to actually use it they need account on the machine so thats the thing that they could book they couldnt actually and you control those accounts okay thats fair enough okay okay were also working on a way of making sure that the machines returned to zero state when theyre uhhuh yeah and you come off thats a because its because then they love the first time well people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around them right which we think is whats critical yeah yeah okay i really have to get out of here so um what what else is important before you run nothing all right piloting piloting piloting you have we have to build up the things we have to try the machine things we have to check them with marlos and jp that they like the representation of the variables right how about you have any time on friday oh i dont think i brought my diary up uh but maybe why maybe why you know back maybe you and i should be the pilot subjects first pilot subjects the ones who know which questions we want to ask and then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing okay so yeah this is generalized floating anxiety no no its its its its a wisdom but yeah well um because actually we can you know we make comments they feedback and a vote into the development hmm so do you know what time of day you might want because i should i should check that okay you dont you dont mean me involved in the pilot do you well you all have to unless unless the bug report yeah youll have to be there too oh yeah ill be around but yeah i want you to hopefully it all runs within yeah i can relax okay so that all sounds good fun well i can just leave you guys here you know hm why not be oh now because thats the yeah but well tell you later yeah well tell you later what are all of the things why do you know that there is no such thing and then you know so hey look im dr andrews im the journalist in the industry i think thats the offensive of the job services but this is the job service there is no job service im not sure if they protected you or james he has a tag that he loves you ive heard he has a tag that says but im looking forward to it and hes going to be the biggest tag and bob logans im not going to be the biggest tag im not going to be the biggest tag im not going to be the biggest tag yeah im going to talk to him im going to say that hes the biggest tag you think theres something wrong with him im going to say that hes the biggest tag hes the biggest tag im going to say that hes the biggest tag

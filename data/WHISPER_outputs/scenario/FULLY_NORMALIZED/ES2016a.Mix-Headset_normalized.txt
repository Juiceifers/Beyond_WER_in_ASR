okay oh that is not going to work oh all right okay okay all right as you all know we are here to create a brand new fantastic remote i am nick tabusk i am the project manager we will just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you are doing what your role is go ahead okay i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirements specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and i will be doing research to figure this out in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i will be doing marketing research on the web and then finally in the detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all of the requirements to see how we did okay hi i am ryan i am the user interface designer likewise i have three different roles for each stage of the design the functional design is looking at the technical functions of remote control in the concept design the user interface how the user reacts with the product and in the detailed design sort of like the user interface design what they are going to be looking for things like fashions what makes it how are we going to make it special that is about it i am manuel and i am the industrial designer in this project in the functional design phase i will be dealing mostly with the requirements we will discuss what the product has to fulfill and so on and so on i suppose we will work pretty much together on that one in the conceptual design i will be mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product and the detailed design and the detailed design i will be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself pretty much working together obviously on the design okay so we have got our opening our agenda is the opening acquaintance which we have kind of done tool training project plan discussion and then closing granted 25 minutes we have here so we are putting together a new remote control we want it to be something original of course we are a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy we want it to be easy to use we have got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design which basically is the three of you and well functional design do we have any ideas of maybe let us just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go into how we are going to design it and how we are going to do the detailing on it well function remote control is just a change of channels as it is main function so we wanted to be a tv remote or i mean do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote i suppose try to make it a university remote it could work on all sort of electrical products in one person is house but you know they also have the same role changing channels voles and then prograing okay i think they all work on the same principles which i actually know i am just saying forget i think yeah universal remote this is my first go around with creating remote control i think we are all on the same boat here one thing i thought of remote control is you always lose them so those are the way i find it quite easily so we should we should fate you set our remote control up to where it has a like a tracking device or like a whistle or make a noise it makes a noise there is a button on the tv that you press okay generally all remote was a sort of quite similar in their pains yeah we want so they are kind of like long and rectangular we want something crazy you know we want something new that is going to stand out i think modern so our remote should be very close maybe like user friendly like a little yeah people i thought maybe because people always sent a theory about the place to where other it was in a ball and actual controls inside well there are of course certain restrictions you cannot have it be any form and fulfill all functions at the same time so there are obviously some restrictions we have to apply here however one question is how stable is that is that thing supposed to be the first of the material pretty much what are we going to build the thing out of how sturdy is it going to be do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever okay so by one yeah so we want to be sturdy we wanted to hold up to somebody is child you know throwing it across the room or as you said people kind of throw it so we want to be a ball shaped you know if it were ball shaped maybe we can be cast on the outside and everything can be inside so we want it to be modern fun sturdy so our form and our function we want it to be easy to find so we want it to be universal it is something that we are supposed to sell for about 25 euros and and for profits are i think somewhere around 50 million euros what they want to make on it also since we are partners of the international remote control association maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal okay that is more on the research end the marketing so marketing you know how maybe marketing you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there yeah and maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences maybe one will not apply to all of the countries we are targeting and you guys have any ideas for what it should look like maybe we could draw it up on the board over there we want to be a ball drop the ball and maybe where the buttons are located my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you this is where it is connected together and then when you open it out it could be a flip like a flip phone and then when you fold it out of the middle maybe a hinge that would be the strongest part of it without if you did use a hinge you are just two parts and then you would have you buttons things inside i think sometimes you are able to have too many buttons so very simple as possible as few as inside as possible and then there was the idea for just something maybe if you have had like some kind of like something or lights around it just looking a bit like some star wars at the moment but yeah that was just a simple idea i did not know you could feel about it was almost be likeable so this is just the idea i had i do not know if there was a other ideas right one problem you would get with this design is the ball is a nice idea because of its stability but of course since it is about it will roll so you would have to have it flat on the side of the east down here somewhere take away that part that is one of the big issues it is also good also you risk the hinges here that is that is a problem yeah they did not have that it is a little bit that is interesting of course but that is of course a weak point yeah how would we go about making you know getting rid of our weak points what i mean but we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball not to put you on the spot but what did you say your title was again i am the industrial designer industrial designer so well the point is well maybe i do not know the shape is perhaps not the most ideal okay as stable as it is there must be a compromise between i am not sure if it is not the most ideal design i mean i am sure i think of like the designer others i cannot think of anything other than the long rectangle for maybe smaller sort of faster ones but yeah there is nothing being done sort of out of that is not new it is not innovative it is you know everybody does longer remote because it is easy it is it is stable i will do something so if no go ahead my idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape you know like video games so but maybe i mean that would be kind of big and bulky we could also try to do the hints then so it could like flip out that way i do not know i think definitely doing something different yeah is a good idea i mean very design something that is sort of like i suppose not always everybody is hands the same but something that would be fit in the hand easier something with a grip yeah grip yeah because even i suppose even with the ball it is still might not be the easiest to hold on to so perhaps the joystick yeah the keyboard idea might work better but then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda so maybe maybe it is the thing is definitely going to be a one handed one handed job i feel like i am just shooting everything down here you are the boss one and a design also the size you know from cell phones they can be too small yeah it is too small it is small it probably looks better but it may not be as functional okay so fortunately we have got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it we have talked about our experiences with remote control and we have got a couple ideas let us see here what if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball the ball function but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side to make it easier to hold on to so so it is easier to hold on to that way of course that will then remove some of our ball unless this unless this part were raised so say the cover flips over and covers that part so the grip is no that would not work either but if we are going to make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sort of grips on the side here i guess and then and then we have the problem with the hinge so if we are flat on the bottom it is not going to roll away it will stay where we want the question is also i do not know do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it that is true it is probably going to lie around open all the time anyway so i do not know if a lid is a good idea it is the ability point of view it certainly is but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident the more we sell so do not make it so we do not have it flip open we just have a ball but then maybe go about to the something i want to know is things okay so then we forget the ball it looks cool but it is really not functional so we have got our sort of keyboard kind but if we flipped it around here so that it were sorry that does not look anything like what you had there so it is up and down you hold it this way of course then it is like the rectangular again only with a couple of judging out points but it is one handed questions what makes those game pads functional i think that is pretty much the form for the hand so it is a round shape underneath that makes it comfy yeah mix it nice so that is the essential part except for that yeah we will not probably not get away from some longer design because you also have to know which way around to point this thing yeah because it does not have a cord like joysticks do batteries go weak as well so after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you want to control with it show which is the front which is the back is it possible to have it to where it would work with like a sensor on either side so that either way you are pointinated will work of course the more technology you stick in that more more it will cost you of course you can do okay i mean of course it will be evident after a while if you look at it it will be evident which way around to point it since you have the nbers and the true the buttons and stuff but it is about the instinctual thing i can just grab a young have to look at it you know which way around to point it otherwise the design of the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work even if you designed it in some in a way that you know is not a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had a definite point so that is your thing so like that instead and then you know which way you are pointinate okay sorry to interrupt but we have a warning are we out of time yeah okay well just to finish up should we go with this plan start making some or good ideas what are not let us say what is the safer next so that what you need to do for next meeting i think what is the finish now so and then marketing will look and see what what people want all right okay project manager will design a better meeting for the next time around for you a little bit more prepared and all right good meeting

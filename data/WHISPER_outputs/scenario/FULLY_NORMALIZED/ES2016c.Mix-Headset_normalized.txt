okay alright all right all right okay all right is everyone here yes yep okay this is our conceptual design meeting i will just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes then each of you will have your presentation and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the virtual and then we will have 40 minutes for finishing up we will go through the meet through the minutes first we just refreshed our goal of making the finest remote control available we decided that we know that we need to use company colors company logo and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with a hundred different remote users and then we will go through the meeting with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before people thought their remotes were ugly that remotes is apillot they only use a finite amount of buttons and that they often lose that is easy to lose remote which were all things we were thinking we would want to make it simple and some sort of locator there is a button or tracking device and that it should look different than what is out there and then we just mixed mixed response on the speech recognition the younger people said they wanted it older people did not and i think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it and that it was probably a giick that would increasingly wear on the consers nerves then the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote the simple versus the complex the simple one being better for a user the complex better for an engineer and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user oriented remote something simple and that we did not want to go with a universal remote because increasing cost and increasing complexity we would just have a tv remote and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote and that would be something that looks different and finally our industrial designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work from energy source what we would use batteries because we do not want to have a cable we would power the remote and the lamp to have one the user interface then would connect to a chip which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the tv and then we came up with a couple ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be something that will fit into easily into someone is hand and with a just a few buttons just the basics and with a scrolling function and i will leave that leave it at that marketing we are watching trends yep i suppose that you can have this okay so i was looking at trend watching unfortunately i was not given too much information i was given a brief executive smary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at and then i will just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that okay the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look and feel design which i think we kind of already discussed before the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative and again these are all things we have kind of already come up with on our own but this just backs it up and thirdly the remote should be easy to use as far as fashion update we have learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths shoes and furniture so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can try and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy and feel okay so from that as we have already said we need to focus on a fancy look and feel i think we have already discovered that it is kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design but i think that even if it is very subtle we need to kind of trick our consers so they at least get the idea that they are getting something that is new and modern and sleek and whether it is through the shape or the colors are all of that for technologically innovative we have talked about the tracking device we brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further and manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface discussing some of those that we could change a little bit we need to keep it simple have limited buttons which i think the 2p is idea might be really beneficial for we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables i do not know i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape and fruit or vegetable or with exterior designs but my question is i mean the stereotype typically speaking you kind of picture males with their remote controls and i am not sure how they would feel about having fruity logos on the outside so maybe we could have something that is somewhat removable or i do not know different options for female male target and then the spongy feel i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that is out there and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy feeling remote controls what is that it is possibly like a surged button for a second possibly like a cover like the head for mobile phones that is what i was thinking and one with a flag and one with a banana and one that is spongy feel to it when you buy your remote you can buy various cover very small personalize we could leave that to the cover department we all know they have got nothing to do all day okay okay i see it yeah i talk about the interface concept and how the customer relates to will use the customer user actual device so i have looked at some of the stuff i was sent trying to get some inspiration but keeping in mind that our own ideas that we had i was sent some information from the company saying that the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you could program questions into such devices he gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question you program the answer and the machine responds accordingly okay there is different ways of a user can use products like remote there is a graphical use where you look at pictures and with on a screen a coand line where you are obviously type things in and you get a response that is just a point out that inconsistent use of interface in remote you cannot see that picture well but there is various different models one is a game with lots of different buttons on they are very cute and well complicated so then i had a look at new products that are on the market not necessarily remote controls but ones that you will recognize there is a voice recognition remote control which can control multiple devices there is a picture on it the serverfabric channels with your voice there are 80 speech samples controls for devices tv cable satellite vcr dvd and audio and you can record your own verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions so the technology is there the one on the left is very similar to what we drew upon the board in the previous meeting where as scrolledout functions on the side you can sort of just make those out and then on the right is obviously an ipod which is possibly one of the simplest things to use out there and all that is just a nice big scroll menu you sort of go through that is a possibility nothing is simple really and there are things like this which is a kids remote where the parents have the facility to control i am prograing on what children can watch before so the remote control only allows them to access the channels at the parents want them to watch and it means that children have a novelty of having their own remote control so i do not know if there is a possibility of having one remote control it is a twocomponent maybe you can have more components different than most the point made at the end there is that you just have to sort of be clear on your devices as to what things you use sometimes an arrow pointing down which may suggest vole down could become the use just as a v for vole just little things like that which would need to be made clear in the design i think you cannot afford to say a user friendly remote with minim buttons maybe we have suggested this twopart thing where if it was to have a speech recognition thing you could maybe control it on the do it all prograable on the control bit and then just have the simple handheld thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote it could be graphical display the actual remote control the actual control port maybe you could have like an ipod we just sort of control through the menus stuff like it gets more complicated and then the handheld thing should be ergonomic in design that is it just just a sideshow yeah and then you have got things like that huge things but just last one 90yearold grandma dustdrilled design yeah cranes stuff like that that makes sense notice the giant dog bone shape it is also good for a sea animals that seems not why is that so well let us see i am going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit the stuff in there i have more information on possible materials as well what we can and cannot do but just wait for this to load up and i will show you what we are talking about here the details of the components design as you can see there what we have is the board the main board of the remote control the underside and it is a pretty cheap piece of technology in top left side you can see the chip which is the we were talking about this this is the device to recognize the signals the input and it passes it on to a row of but the transistor is in stuff like that on the right side that actually amplifies the signal which later on has been transferred to a infrared lamp which then of course shines infrared light onto the television which then recognize what signal it is getting and what you tell it so much for the workings of the remote control itself it is job is to wait for you to press a key then to translate that to keep pressing infrared light signals that are received by the television when you press a key you complete a specific connection the chip senses the connection knows what button you press it produces a more scope line signal specific to that button right clear transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the signal to the led which translates the signal to infrared light the sensor in the tv can see the infrared light and seeing the signal the exit appropriately this is the circuit board from the other side the lower part of it as you can see are properly green greenish board is what we saw in the first slide just flipped over you can see the circuit board itself it is the cheapest way to make electronic connections basically on the market what you do as you have do not have cables but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board these are the actual keys that are being pressed they are closed at the electric circuit that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side that will be behind here which sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff it amplifies the signal and all that it is being sent to the infrared lamp up there now you see this is the rubber button version of it the way it works is that you have the keys here the rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side which closes the circuit here and thus gives on the signal now this is the simple version we are talking it is the simple and cheapest version at the same time we are talking something more complicated of course it is going to be more expensive as well not only that we also restricted the use of our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell i have gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic rubber as well rather than it is used in antistress balls so it is pretty squishy that would serve that purpose we could also use wood or titani let us see a proximate cost per 100000 for the titani oh i do not have an information on that however our company obviously can provide us with the titani so i asse i was given an okay to use it it certainly is an expensive material i am aware of that but i was given an okay but there are certain restrictions to certain materials now let us first go through the list of the materials so what we can use is plastic rubber wood and titani so mix these the vole has for the energy source we are talking about that shortly in the other meeting what we could use is or what i was offered or what we could use is a basic material battery a dynamo interestingly enough we could use solar cells or a device that was not much further specified that provides kinetic energy such as watches we just move them move the actual device and this provides some energy obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of question you do not want to wind up your most control before you can use it right solar cell is interesting may fail though everything in there but yesterday we have been wind up i do not know yeah or you do use it the device behind the couch for a week works well in arizona but in edinburgh not exactly so the kinetic energy thing might work but the same problem you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it starts to work so i would say what we are stuck with really is the basic battery which also makes a base station basically absolutely only that however our interface options are push buttons in which the production of which or the manufacturer of which company is expert however we have discussed that scroll wheels are a better option and they are possible we have an ok for scroll wheels however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i have one big objection that is that we have to fit an lcd into the remote control as well this however may exclude certain materials we have a squishy kind of remote control then an lcd screen may be affected by the movement because we might not be able to put it in there so there is also restrictions to when it comes to the chip if we have a sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic setup that we have just presented the chip has to be more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well i do not have any details to come to the cost but it will be significant difference i would rather say drop the titani and therefore that is how it is more sophisticated chip but that is not up to me to decide so that is for the scroll wheel it limits our choice and squishy is hip so i would say rather not go for that let us see now solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control but obviously that is not a problem since we have decided or against solar cells i asse right or anybody still i think batteries are probably the way to go she makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i asse with the titani we come out to make it a curved design which is able to make it flat and a straight design pretty much which i asse would exclude in the most sophisticated versions with the sort of spongy and plasticky thing you can get those mobile phones and initially have a plastic but then they have sort of a cover on it which is just sort of soft stuff so i do not know if that is still possible to have you know they are open and plastic whether people hold it still be sort of spongy and we can have the fruits and vegetables on this 25th i can remove it so it was the possibility of having a graphical display on it like a screen like i can have a lcd screen but therefore no rubber will be used right right so plastic is titani yes but this will of course influence the form the plastic design the standard you can use any form the latex is tricky or rubber and titani also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form so the way to go is if you want to scroll we will either make it flat and angular add an lcd screen and then you can basically choose either plastic or titani or wood if you want to make it a particular shape use plastic add an lcd screen add a scroll wheel little bit fine or make it just push buttons basically plastic gives you the biggest variety of options maybe not the nicest feel so the rubbery we can shave it however we want or the rubbery we cannot so the rubbery we could treat much shape at the way we wanted it but we cannot as well wheels and we cannot add an lcd screen that is the tricky thing could we not you know have a shape with the scroll on the screen and then this initial shape we had which is sort of a bananaesque that is the whole thing if you did it yellow and you just stick on just some other things and that is all quick from there they would not have anything just on the exterior they would not be necessary to the actual shape of the thing is that an option a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on had certain spots certainly can be done yes yeah that does not affect the functional side of it all just the underside of the thing it can be done right you see it so the fruit design how about affecting the surface of the actual rainbow control say we do not make it with the particular fruit shape obviously but do it like the surface of an orange banana whatever you name it what about a smell it is the remote nice one you could just add it in different colors as well i suppose different colors right the colors yeah oh those colors are just different well we are supposed to stick to the colors yeah yeah company cars yellow and gray so what have we lemon banana grapefruit grapefruit grapefruit this is what we go for it comes to the auto appearance perhaps i would say if i were to make a decision i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectr of importance i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous yeah what we have it oh we kind of did yeah well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lower that fruit fruitminded from both of the buyer it is yellow it is yellow it is curved yeah so why not add a couple of grazed stripes a couple of grazed stripes we could put the grazed stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over if it would look like a banana just sit it on their table yeah there you go rather than rather and then you could actually put the banana shape thing on the fruit moment maybe the holder if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a grape it could be an ape or a fruit ball we could have a variety of options here okay yeah do you have more tier presentation that is pretty much it and from you about the materials what the interior has to look like and what the limitations to certain materials are okay i am going to plug in here real quick sure i could like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here oh no no does the two piece idea out probably not decided we sort of i want to go with that because if we are going to use a battery in the base station might not be necessary well we can still design a two piece remote without having a base having one of them be a base station but just having it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions or who take out a smaller piece we can still do that however of course it would be like designing two remote so which then design is standard would probably limit the dimit again the to use certain materials because they would be too expensive they like sprawl wheel on both of them or have a lcd screen and so on you probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there but could be done of course okay so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source the chip on print and the case probably case material and probably a shape also and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what what the type is and what kind of supplements will have energy source i think we have i think we have decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet we have five minutes so the chip on print as i said the more advanced features you want the fancy of the chip has to be in the more expensive if you want just a normal button version chip on print is going to be a cheap one so i guess we should pick the case then if we go with the plastic case or the plastic case then the chip on print is still kind of we could have either or we could have a complex one or a non complex but did we decide that the rubbery feel is important enough to us what about what you said just bigger groups okay so we would we would have the lcd screen as long as the other rubber is nowhere near the controls yes so i guess the case would be plastic with perhaps that is not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it it is more of a supplement maybe more of a lamination perhaps so then for the scroll are we going for the ipod type yeah i think so which will require a more expensive chip on print right yes it does you you you know i guess that is that about it so we have a good idea of what we are going to need to do on this okay so we will have another meeting in 30 minutes here is what is going to be going on ryan you will be working on the user interface design you will be working on the look and field design kryn will want a product evaluation and the two of you get to play with the modeling components and maybe and get us a prototype which should go along well with your look and field design and your interface so that basically will just be working on the prototype we will accomplish your other two actions all right okay let us do it

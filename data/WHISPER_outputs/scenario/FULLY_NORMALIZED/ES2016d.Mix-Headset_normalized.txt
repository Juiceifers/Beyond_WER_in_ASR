yep swimsay let us okay this is our last meeting i will go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting and then we will have a prototype presentation then we will do an evaluation or we will see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation then we will go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget then we will do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with the changes that we will need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line see minutes from the last meeting we looked at the trends we had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel it was twice as important as anything else they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype they wanted limited buttons and simplicity then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote looking at other devices the ipod we really liked to look at that we also had the kids remote for simple idea a two part remote which was what we were originally looking at then there was tacos speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use but i think we still decided not to go with that then we looked at the components the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote and basically what we were making for the prototype so i am going to leave it at that and let you guys take over the process is a discussion the prototype do you need this no there you go there you go there you go basically we went with the color yellow working on the principle of fruit which was mentioned is basically designing around a banana but it would be held in such a fashion where it obviously would not be that floppy because this would be hard plastic these would be like the rubber grips so that is how hopefully we grip like the ergonomics of it but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel to use your imagination and this here represents the screen where you would go through and the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod that will not work through channels that with other way through channels vole up and down and to access the more complicated functions so i will press that and go through the menus that is simple that is just representably infrared beam that is a simple analog switch i do not know we could use the voice that blue bits should be yellow that would be where the battery should be i suppose and that is about it this is simple we can make it really is there anything you ought to add what we have there that is plastic plastic covered with rubber we might add some more underneath here maybe give it a form i am supposed to hold it like that but just if you grab it yeah just make sure she works yeah left handed all right exactly you know might as well yeah think about the button yeah either put either one on the side what not doing it all just the only one quick one off button that is yeah i think it is pretty important so you do not have to fiddle with that okay that is that i would say a bit smaller would probably be nice yeah play with that over there nice flimsy because it is made up heavy lighter yeah yeah yeah yeah well done kind of a banana no whether or not it would fall into the coste everything i suppose would they scroll and they all say they well luckily we are going to find out or not likely do you have a marketing idea presentation of yours okay you guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria h okay so i am going to do a presentation of the criteria that i found just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier and then we will do a group evaluation of the prototype and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did so the criteria we are going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who are going to be doing it based on a seven point scale and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that what is seven being false we did not achieve that okay so for the first one we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly reload i think it is definitely different than anything else out there so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say most definitely it is bright it is bright it still has your traditional black it is curved it is no there is no sharp and goes to that angular i would say it comes to the ergonomics of the form and stuff yes that is definitely more beautiful than your average however the color i think color is the track so that has been dictated pretty much by the company that is true to answer that honestly i would rather say we have not solved the problem completely we would mode because the color is ugly there is nothing you can say about that i much prefer something like brushed chrome yeah that form yeah something more modern to go right a modern color to go with the modern form you do not want your three feet huge lcd display in your living room that is hanged from the wall to be controlled with someone that okay so do you think since we this was not assigned criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them is that something good yeah yeah what do you think three four four four four is there okay very noncoittal for okay the second one did we make it simple for new users it is very intuitive i think so yeah so that was the main name my name is what we had do the one one yeah okay okay okay do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users yeah because we have brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most coon channel and vole and then the other one was just a massive just going just scrolling further just scrolling through and selecting so one so that is one yeah i think that is one okay okay the fourth one how about the problem of a remote being easily lost one of the nber one so i think that big and that yellow you just what is right here in the bright end but if we were to if we were to if we were to that the speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing that was so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then just just use to find it lost but like i said i do not you lose something so you know so easily and it is not going to fall like a rectangle slip down behind things that is going to be difficult shape to what is quite bright maybe in the middle again four i mean you know losing things is one of those things that people can lose yeah if you are going to be able to get in the middle and wide you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you lost it yeah but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it and our skill goes up quite a bit oh yeah probably two you know if we eliminate the fact that you know it is impossible to guarantee that it is not going to be lost then let us say it too with speech recognition and of course may be changed depending on budget yeah you could add an extra feature actually which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television yeah we could add that but that is nothing we have thought of which maybe cheaper than speech recognition yeah true i mean just as whistling clapping and giving you that shape so i cannot be that it is based on anti antifascist technology it is the technology suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that is attached to your luggage and another piece that starts beeping that cannot cost much yeah so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your tv and the other the prayed that you do not accidentally lose that piece right that would be tough well also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your tv to your television run off without taking the beautiful remote control yeah so are we adding one of these two features let us add one of those features and say yes okay that is two of one or two two okay okay are we technologically innovative i just want to show do not get my name up it is all just it is all just it is all just stolen yeah i thought it was yeah but there is not a lot of yellow there is not a lot of yellow of course i was not really you are kind of forced to take that color two okay i do not know the way that we are that innovative no not true but how many remote steers do you see like this if we added the screaming factor can we go up i would say we are probably up for really it is going to hurt us okay spungy material yeah we have some splashes it is made of okay it is not a one though one would be the whole thing yeah because it is only got to fold but these parts of the grips and perhaps the backside the bottom underneath on the back so that is a four probably a four at most and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics yes yeah if your fashion is but is carmen miranda you betcha well the recent fashion has rather displayed in the lcd it is true it is the way you operate it and form on the color but it definitely is this is what we were told let us say that is the thing okay all right now i just got to calculate six 17 to the bed of us what is about it h seven is two point four well i have been done math what i am sure you have got one okay what is that two point four to right how is that work it is pressed i cannot do that without it yeah it is been a while and what is the acceptable criteria is there like a scale that we have to hit oh no it just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically all right that is that okay well let us see now we get to do the budget nbers you did not know that you were going to have a budget but we do okay we have been going a long time i am not going to have two point four to eight i said this keeps going oh yeah two point four to eight yeah we will go ahead so i have here 50 you are pretty yeah we want a 50 profit on this i cannot really see that very well josh about 50 is a quick thing 125 euros is what is supposed to cost us okay so too much well let us see the i like this okay all right so the top i do not know if you guys can read that enough i cannot sit on my glasses on but so we have got the energy source there is a four so we have six categories we have energy source electronics case then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements okay so first of all energy source we pick battery and how many batteries do we think this will probably take probably so either two or four two like it four is going to be too heavy so that is not our problem people can change it every month they will not excellent they bought it this is conserism all right so for the electronics our choices are simple chip on print regular chip on print events chip on print sample sensor sample speaker or a bunch of chip on print that is the advanced chip on print okay we have one of those okay then the case is a probably it is double curved case materials are plastic plastic i guess it is two since one for the top one for the bottom is that right or is it just one oh maybe it is one because of the single mode you can do that yeah i guess it does not matter because the price on that one is zero which is the special color that is not a special color especially ugly color interface type we have push button scroll wheel interface integrated scroll wheel push button and lcd display so we actually have the lcd display and then is it the integrated or yes okay button supplement special color special form special material we could of course make the buttons wood same how can they really or titani the cost is all the same but we only have one button so really we should not be church we should not be churched anything the button supplements yeah i think no okay we are going to leave that one blank because we run on lcd and scroll so our total is 155 which i believe is by three euros over so we go for the hand dynamics so the only thing better than if a nana is shape remote is one that you shake what if we complete and took out the one single button we have got on and just had a scroll wheel interface and the lcd display i suppose the lcd display is the one that is putting out for that yeah well because we have to have all of right yeah that is that is face it it also depends on the software on the television you can have the information of this in terms of it and you can have the display on the screen yeah you could maybe take out the lcd display even if it comes up on the computer itself on tv itself so we may not need the lcd display no it is possible right we may not need it there you go there we go 125 okay so we just remove our screen screen here okay a big a dial easy to use even easy to use on besides look at what the lcd does to our lovely remote okay back to the design room boys take away i got a lot of what is the blue part that was just we got out of yellow there you go there you go even simpler looks more like a banana yeah those fruit lovers out there okay so costs under 125 euro there is no we redesigned it yeah now it is yes next slide project evaluation project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found so i guess that i think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me but i would like to hear your thoughts kind of fill in some time what did you think of our project process yeah i think we know quite well yeah right from the start of the day yeah we are just new where we were going to try to last we started off a little little week and leadership was quite weak in the beginning but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing room for creativity there was that i think we tried a lot of different things i think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were doing right on with a lot of those things and you guys worked together well as a team and the means which was the whiteboard and the pens i had some problem with the pen i think i have some powerpoint yes i am not sure no i know people have worked for but the work yeah yeah i have a list of employees that you would like fired yes okay new ideas found yes for the remote maybe no not technology closing coster within the budget project is evaluated and then we have a list of employees that we have we have a list of employees that we have complete final questionnaire and meeting someone that is it excellent i still have to do my minutes that is waiting actually so there will probably be another question and then we will have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that that is the end of our meeting

yep swimsay lets okay this is our last meeting ill go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting and then well have a prototype presentation then we will do an evaluation or well see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation then well go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget then well do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with the changes that well need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line see minutes from the last meeting we looked at the trends we had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel it was twice as important as anything else they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype they wanted limited buttons and simplicity then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote looking at other devices the ipod we really liked to look at that we also had the kids remote for simple idea a two part remote which was what we were originally looking at then there was tacos speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use but i think we still decided not to go with that then we looked at the components the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote and basically what we were making for the prototype so im going to leave it at that and let you guys take over the process is a discussion the prototype do you need this no there you go there you go there you go basically we went with the color yellow working on the principle of fruit which was mentioned is basically designing around a banana but it would be held in such a fashion where it obviously wouldnt be that floppy because this would be hard plastic these would be like the rubber grips so thats how hopefully we grip like the ergonomics of it but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel to use your imagination and this here represents the screen where youd go through and the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod that wont work through channels that with other way through channels vole up and down and to access the more complicated functions so ill press that and go through the menus thats simple thats just representably infrared beam thats a simple analog switch i dont know we could use the voice that blue bits should be yellow thatd be where the battery should be i suppose and thats about it this is simple we can make it really is there anything you ought to add what we have there thats plastic plastic covered with rubber we might add some more underneath here maybe give it a form im supposed to hold it like that but just if you grab it yeah just make sure she works yeah left handed all right exactly you know might as well yeah think about the button yeah either put either one on the side what not doing it all just the only one quick one off button thats yeah i think its pretty important so you dont have to fiddle with that okay thats that id say a bit smaller would probably be nice yeah play with that over there nice flimsy because its made up heavy lighter yeah yeah yeah yeah well done kind of a banana no whether or not it would fall into the coste everything i suppose would they scroll and they all say they well luckily we are going to find out or not likely do you have a marketing idea presentation of yours okay you guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria h okay so im going to do a presentation of the criteria that i found just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier and then well do a group evaluation of the prototype and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did so the criteria were going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who are going to be doing it based on a seven point scale and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that whats seven being false we did not achieve that okay so for the first one we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly reload i think its definitely different than anything else out there so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say most definitely its bright its bright it still has your traditional black its curved its no theres no sharp and goes to that angular id say it comes to the ergonomics of the form and stuff yes thats definitely more beautiful than your average however the color i think color is the track so that has been dictated pretty much by the company thats true to answer that honestly i would rather say we have not solved the problem completely we would mode because the color is ugly theres nothing you can say about that i much prefer something like brushed chrome yeah that form yeah something more modern to go right a modern color to go with the modern form you dont want your three feet huge lcd display in your living room thats hanged from the wall to be controlled with someone that okay so do you think since we this wasnt assigned criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them is that something good yeah yeah what do you think three four four four four is there okay very noncoittal for okay the second one did we make it simple for new users its very intuitive i think so yeah so that was the main name my name is what we had do the one one yeah okay okay okay do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users yeah because weve brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most coon channel and vole and then the other one was just a massive just going just scrolling further just scrolling through and selecting so one so thats one yeah i think thats one okay okay the fourth one how about the problem of a remote being easily lost one of the nber one so i think that big and that yellow you just what is right here in the bright end but if we were to if we were to if we were to that the speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing that was so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then just just use to find it lost but like i said i dont you lose something so you know so easily and its not going to fall like a rectangle slip down behind things thats going to be difficult shape to what is quite bright maybe in the middle again four i mean you know losing things is one of those things that people can lose yeah if youre going to be able to get in the middle and wide you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you lost it yeah but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it and our skill goes up quite a bit oh yeah probably two you know if we eliminate the fact that you know its impossible to guarantee that its not going to be lost then lets say it too with speech recognition and of course may be changed depending on budget yeah you could add an extra feature actually which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television yeah we could add that but thats nothing we have thought of which maybe cheaper than speech recognition yeah true i mean just as whistling clapping and giving you that shape so i cant be that its based on anti antifascist technology its the technology suitcases and stuff where you have one piece thats attached to your luggage and another piece that starts beeping that cant cost much yeah so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your tv and the other the prayed that you dont accidentally lose that piece right thatd be tough well also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your tv to your television run off without taking the beautiful remote control yeah so are we adding one of these two features lets add one of those features and say yes okay thats two of one or two two okay okay are we technologically innovative i just want to show dont get my name up its all just its all just its all just stolen yeah i thought it was yeah but theres not a lot of yellow theres not a lot of yellow of course i wasnt really youre kind of forced to take that color two okay i dont know the way that we are that innovative no not true but how many remote steers do you see like this if we added the screaming factor can we go up i would say were probably up for really its going to hurt us okay spungy material yeah we have some splashes its made of okay its not a one though one would be the whole thing yeah because its only got to fold but these parts of the grips and perhaps the backside the bottom underneath on the back so thats a four probably a four at most and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics yes yeah if your fashion is but is carmen miranda you betcha well the recent fashion has rather displayed in the lcd its true its the way you operate it and form on the color but it definitely is this is what we were told lets say thats the thing okay all right now i just got to calculate six 17 to the bed of us whats about it seven is two point four well ive been done math what im sure youve got one okay whats that two point four to right hows that work its pressed i cant do that without it yeah its been a while and what is the acceptable criteria is there like a scale that we have to hit oh no it just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically all right thats that okay well lets see now we get to do the budget nbers you didnt know that you were going to have a budget but we do okay weve been going a long time im not going to have two point four to eight i said this keeps going oh yeah two point four to eight yeah well go ahead so i have here 50 youre pretty yeah we want a 50 profit on this i cant really see that very well josh about 50 is a quick thing 125 euros is whats supposed to cost us okay so too much well lets see the i like this okay all right so the top i dont know if you guys can read that enough i cant sit on my glasses on but so weve got the energy source theres a four so we have six categories we have energy source electronics case then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements okay so first of all energy source we pick battery and how many batteries do we think this will probably take probably so either two or four two like it four is going to be too heavy so thats not our problem people can change it every month they wont excellent they bought it this is conserism all right so for the electronics our choices are simple chip on print regular chip on print events chip on print sample sensor sample speaker or a bunch of chip on print thats the advanced chip on print okay we have one of those okay then the case is a probably its double curved case materials are plastic plastic i guess its two since one for the top one for the bottom is that right or is it just one oh maybe its one because of the single mode you can do that yeah i guess it doesnt matter because the price on that one is zero which is the special color thats not a special color especially ugly color interface type we have push button scroll wheel interface integrated scroll wheel push button and lcd display so we actually have the lcd display and then is it the integrated or yes okay button supplement special color special form special material we could of course make the buttons wood same how can they really or titani the cost is all the same but we only have one button so really we shouldnt be church we shouldnt be churched anything the button supplements yeah i think no okay were going to leave that one blank because we run on lcd and scroll so our total is 155 which i believe is by three euros over so we go for the hand dynamics so the only thing better than if a nanas shape remote is one that you shake what if we complete and took out the one single button weve got on and just had a scroll wheel interface and the lcd display i suppose the lcd display is the one thats putting out for that yeah well because we have to have all of right yeah thats thats face it it also depends on the software on the television you can have the information of this in terms of it and you can have the display on the screen yeah you could maybe take out the lcd display even if it comes up on the computer itself on tv itself so we may not need the lcd display no its possible right we may not need it there you go there we go 125 okay so we just remove our screen screen here okay a big a dial easy to use even easy to use on besides look at what the lcd does to our lovely remote okay back to the design room boys take away i got a lot of whats the blue part that was just we got out of yellow there you go there you go even simpler looks more like a banana yeah those fruit lovers out there okay so costs under 125 euro theres no we redesigned it yeah now its yes next slide project evaluation project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found so i guess that i think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me but id like to hear your thoughts kind of fill in some time what did you think of our project process yeah i think we know quite well yeah right from the start of the day yeah were just new where we were going to try to last we started off a little little week and leadership was quite weak in the beginning but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing room for creativity there was that i think we tried a lot of different things i think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were doing right on with a lot of those things and you guys worked together well as a team and the means which was the whiteboard and the pens i had some problem with the pen i think i have some powerpoint yes im not sure no i know people have worked for but the work yeah yeah i have a list of employees that you would like fired yes okay new ideas found yes for the remote maybe no not technology closing coster within the budget project is evaluated and then we have a list of employees that we have we have a list of employees that we have complete final questionnaire and meeting someone thats it excellent i still have to do my minutes thats waiting actually so there will probably be another question and then well have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that thats the end of our meeting

okay oh thats not going to work oh all right okay okay all right as you all know were here to create a brand new fantastic remote im nick tabusk im the project manager well just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what youre doing what your role is go ahead okay im corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirements specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and ill be doing research to figure this out in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and ill be doing marketing research on the web and then finally in the detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all of the requirements to see how we did okay hi im ryan im the user interface designer likewise i have three different roles for each stage of the design the functional design is looking at the technical functions of remote control in the concept design the user interface how the user reacts with the product and in the detailed design sort of like the user interface design what theyre going to be looking for things like fashions what makes it how are we going to make it special thats about it im manuel and im the industrial designer in this project in the functional design phase ill be dealing mostly with the requirements well discuss what the product has to fulfill and so on and so on i suppose well work pretty much together on that one in the conceptual design ill be mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product and the detailed design and the detailed design ill be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself pretty much working together obviously on the design okay so weve got our opening our agenda is the opening acquaintance which weve kind of done tool training project plan discussion and then closing granted 25 minutes we have here so we are putting together a new remote control we want it to be something original of course were a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy we want it to be easy to use weve got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design which basically is the three of you and well functional design do we have any ideas of maybe lets just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go into how were going to design it and how were going to do the detailing on it well function remote control is just a change of channels as its main function so we wanted to be a tv remote or i mean do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote i suppose try to make it a university remote it could work on all sort of electrical products in one persons house but you know they also have the same role changing channels volumes and then programming okay i think they all work on the same principles which i actually know im just saying forget i think yeah universal remote this is my first go around with creating remote control i think were all on the same boat here one thing i thought of remote control is you always lose them so those are the way i find it quite easily so we should we should fate you set our remote control up to where it has a like a tracking device or like a whistle or make a noise it makes a noise theres a button on the tv that you press okay generally all remote was a sort of quite similar in their pains yeah we want so theyre kind of like long and rectangular we want something crazy you know we want something new thats going to stand out i think modern so our remote should be very close maybe like user friendly like a little yeah people i thought maybe because people always sent a theory about the place to where other it was in a ball and actual controls inside well there are of course certain restrictions you cant have it be any form and fulfill all functions at the same time so there are obviously some restrictions we have to apply here however one question is how stable is that is that thing supposed to be the first of the material pretty much what are we going to build the thing out of how sturdy is it going to be do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever okay so by one yeah so we want to be sturdy we wanted to hold up to somebodys child you know throwing it across the room or as you said people kind of throw it so we want to be a ball shaped you know if it were ball shaped maybe we can be cast on the outside and everything can be inside so we want it to be modern fun sturdy so our form and our function we want it to be easy to find so we want it to be universal its something that were supposed to sell for about 25 euros and and for profits are i think somewhere around 50 million euros what they want to make on it also since were partners of the international remote control association maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal okay thats more on the research end the marketing so marketing you know how maybe marketing you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there yeah and maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences maybe one wont apply to all of the countries were targeting and you guys have any ideas for what it should look like maybe we could draw it up on the board over there we want to be a ball drop the ball and maybe where the buttons are located my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you this is where its connected together and then when you open it out it could be a flip like a flip phone and then when you fold it out of the middle maybe a hinge thatd be the strongest part of it without if you did use a hinge youre just two parts and then youd have you buttons things inside i think sometimes youre able to have too many buttons so very simple as possible as few as inside as possible and then there was the idea for just something maybe if you have had like some kind of like something or lights around it just looking a bit like some star wars at the moment but yeah that was just a simple idea i didnt know you could feel about it was almost be likeable so this is just the idea i had i dont know if there was a other ideas right one problem youd get with this design is the ball is a nice idea because of its stability but of course since its about itll roll so youd have to have it flat on the side of the east down here somewhere take away that part thats one of the big issues its also good also you risk the hinges here thats thats a problem yeah they didnt have that its a little bit thats interesting of course but thats of course a weak point yeah how would we go about making you know getting rid of our weak points what i mean but we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball not to put you on the spot but what did you say your title was again im the industrial designer industrial designer so well the point is well maybe i dont know the shape is perhaps not the most ideal okay as stable as it is there must be a compromise between im not sure if its not the most ideal design i mean im sure i think of like the designer others i cant think of anything other than the long rectangle for maybe smaller sort of faster ones but yeah theres nothing being done sort of out of thats not new its not innovative its you know everybody does longer remote because its easy its its stable ill do something so if no go ahead my idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape you know like video games so but maybe i mean that would be kind of big and bulky we could also try to do the hints then so it could like flip out that way i dont know i think definitely doing something different yeah is a good idea i mean very design something thats sort of like i suppose not always everybodys hands the same but something that would be fit in the hand easier something with a grip yeah grip yeah because even i suppose even with the ball its still might not be the easiest to hold on to so perhaps the joystick yeah the keyboard idea might work better but then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda so maybe maybe its the thing is definitely going to be a one handed one handed job i feel like im just shooting everything down here youre the boss one and a design also the size you know from cell phones they can be too small yeah its too small its small it probably looks better but it may not be as functional okay so fortunately weve got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it weve talked about our experiences with remote control and weve got a couple ideas lets see here what if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball the ball function but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side to make it easier to hold on to so so its easier to hold on to that way of course thatll then remove some of our ball unless this unless this part were raised so say the cover flips over and covers that part so the grip is no that wouldnt work either but if were going to make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sort of grips on the side here i guess and then and then we have the problem with the hinge so if were flat on the bottom its not going to roll away itll stay where we want the question is also i dont know do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it thats true its probably going to lie around open all the time anyway so i dont know if a lid is a good idea its the ability point of view it certainly is but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident the more we sell so dont make it so we dont have it flip open we just have a ball but then maybe go about to the something i want to know is things okay so then we forget the ball it looks cool but its really not functional so weve got our sort of keyboard kind but if we flipped it around here so that it were sorry that doesnt look anything like what you had there so its up and down you hold it this way of course then its like the rectangular again only with a couple of judging out points but its one handed questions what makes those game pads functional i think thats pretty much the form for the hand so its a round shape underneath that makes it comfy yeah mix it nice so thats the essential part except for that yeah well not probably not get away from some longer design because you also have to know which way around to point this thing yeah because it doesnt have a cord like joysticks do batteries go weak as well so after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you want to control with it show which is the front which is the back is it possible to have it to where it would work with like a sensor on either side so that either way youre pointinated will work of course the more technology you stick in that more more itll cost you of course you can do okay i mean of course it will be evident after a while if you look at it it will be evident which way around to point it since you have the numbers and the true the buttons and stuff but its about the instinctual thing i can just grab a young have to look at it you know which way around to point it otherwise the design of the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work even if you designed it in some in a way that you know isnt a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had a definite point so thats your thing so like that instead and then you know which way youre pointinate okay sorry to interrupt but we have a warning are we out of time yeah okay well just to finish up should we go with this plan start making some or good ideas what are not lets say whats the safer next so that what you need to do for next meeting i think whats the finish now so and then marketing will look and see what what people want all right okay project manager will design a better meeting for the next time around for you a little bit more prepared and all right good meeting

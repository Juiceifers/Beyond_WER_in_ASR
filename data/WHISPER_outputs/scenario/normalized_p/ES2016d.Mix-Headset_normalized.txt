yep, swimsay. let's- okay, this is our last meeting. i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting and then we'll have a prototype presentation. then we will do an evaluation or we'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation. then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget. then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with the changes that we'll need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line. see minutes from the last meeting, we looked at the trends. we had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel. it was twice as important as anything else. they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel. so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype. they wanted limited buttons and simplicity. then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote, looking at other devices, the ipod. we really liked to look at that. we also had the kids remote for simple idea, a two part remote, which was what we were originally looking at. then there was tacos. speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use. but i think we still decided not to go with that. then we looked at the components, the materials for the case, the different energy sources, the different types of chips, and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote and basically what we were making for the prototype. so i'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over. the process is a discussion. the prototype. do you need this? no. there you go. there you go. there you go. basically we went with the color yellow. working on the principle of fruit, which was mentioned, is basically designing around a banana. but it would be held in such a fashion where it obviously wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic. these would be like the rubber grips. so that's how hopefully we grip. like the ergonomics of it. but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel. to use your imagination. and this here represents the screen where you'd go through. and the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod. that won't work through channels, that with other way through channels, volume up and down. and to access the more complicated functions. so i'll press that and go through the menus. that's simple. that's just representably infrared beam. that's a simple analog switch. i don't know. we could use the voice. that blue bits should be yellow. that'd be where the battery should be. i suppose. and that's about it. this is simple. we can make it really. is there anything you ought to add? what we have there. that's plastic. plastic covered with rubber. we might add some more underneath here. maybe give it a form. i'm supposed to hold it like that. but just if you grab it. yeah. just make sure she works. yeah. left handed all right. exactly. you know. might as well. yeah. think about the button. yeah. either put either one on the side. what? not doing it all. just the only one. quick one off button. that's. yeah. i think it's pretty important. so you don't have to fiddle with that. okay. that's that. i'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice. yeah. play with that over there. nice flimsy because it's made up heavy. lighter. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. well done. kind of a banana. no, whether or not it would fall into the costume. everything i suppose. would they scroll and they all say they. well, luckily we are going to find out. or not likely. do you have a marketing idea presentation of yours? okay. you guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria. hmm. okay. so i'm going to do a presentation of the criteria that i found just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier. and then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype. and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did. so the criteria we're going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who are going to be doing it based on a seven point scale. and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that. what's seven being false? we did not achieve that. okay. so for the first one, we need to decide, did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly reload? i think it's definitely different than anything else out there. so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes. i would say most definitely it's bright. it's bright. it still has your traditional black. it's curved. it's no, there's no sharp. and goes to that angular. i'd say it comes to the ergonomics of the form and stuff. yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average. however, the color. i think color is the track. so that has been dictated pretty much by the company. that's true. to answer that honestly, i would rather say we have not solved the problem completely. we would mode because the color is ugly. there's nothing you can say about that. i much prefer something like brushed chrome. yeah. that form. yeah. something more modern to go. right. a modern color to go with the modern form. you don't want your three feet huge lcd display in your living room that's hanged from the wall to be controlled with someone that. okay. so do you think since we this wasn't assigned criteria, do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them? is that something good? yeah. yeah. what do you think? three, four. four. four. four is there. okay. very non-committal for. okay. the second one. did we make it simple for new users? it's very intuitive. i think so. yeah. so that was the main name. my name is what we had. do the one. one. yeah. okay. okay. okay. do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users? yeah. because we've brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common channel and volume. and then the other one was just a massive. just going. just scrolling further. just scrolling through and selecting. so one. so that's one. yeah. i think that's one. okay. okay. the fourth one. how about the problem of a remote being easily lost? one of the number one. so i think that big and that yellow you just. what is right here in the bright end? but if we were to. if we were to. if we were to. that the speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing. that was. so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then just just use to find it lost but like i said. i don't. you lose something so you know so easily. and it's not going to fall. like a rectangle. slip down behind things that's going to be difficult shape to. what is quite bright. maybe in the middle again. four. i mean, you know losing things is one of those things that people can lose. yeah. if you're going to be able to get in the middle and wide you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you lost it. yeah. but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it. and our skill goes up quite a bit. oh yeah. probably two. you know, if we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost then. let's say it too. with speech recognition. and of course, may be changed depending on budget. yeah. you could add an extra feature actually which makes this thing. raise hell when you remove it too far from television. yeah. we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of. which maybe cheaper than speech recognition. yeah. true. i mean, just as whistling clapping and giving you that shape. so i can't be that. it's based on anti anti-fascist technology. it's the technology. suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage and another piece that starts beeping. that can't cost much. yeah. so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide. so you have one piece. you have to glue somewhere behind your tv. and the other. the prayed that you don't accidentally lose that piece. right. that'd be tough. well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your tv to your television. run off without taking the beautiful remote control. yeah. so are we adding one of these two features? let's add one of those features and say yes. okay. that's two of one or two. two. okay. okay. are we technologically innovative? i just want to show. don't get my name up. it's all just. it's all just. it's all just stolen. yeah. i thought it was. yeah. but there's not a lot of yellow. there's not a lot of yellow. of course, i wasn't really. you're kind of forced to take that color. two. okay. i don't know the way that we are that innovative. no, not true. but how many remote steers do you see like this? if we added the screaming factor, can we go up? i would say we're probably up for. really? it's going to hurt us. okay. spungy material. yeah, we have some splashes. it's made of. okay. it's not a one though. one would be the whole thing. yeah, because it's only got to fold. but these parts of the grips and perhaps the backside, the bottom underneath on the back. so that's a four. probably a four at most. and lastly, did we put the fashion in electronics? yes. yeah, if your fashion is, but is carmen miranda? you betcha. well, the recent fashion has rather displayed in the lcd. it's true. it's the way you operate it and form on the color. but it definitely is. this is what we were told. let's say that's the thing. okay. all right. now i just got to calculate six. 17 to the bed of us. what's about it, huh? seven is two point four. well, i've been done math. what? i'm sure you've got one. okay, what's that two point four to? right? how's that work? it's pressed. i can't do that without it. yeah. it's been a while. and what is the acceptable criteria? is there like a scale that we have to hit? oh, no. it just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it. basically. all right. that's that. okay. well, let's see. now we get to do the budget numbers. you didn't know that you were going to have a budget. but we do. okay. we've been going a long time. i'm not going to have two point four to eight. i said this keeps going. oh, yeah. two point four to eight. yeah, we'll go ahead. so i have here 50%. you're pretty. yeah. we want a 50% profit on this. i can't really see that very well. josh, about 50% is a quick thing. 12.5 euros is what's supposed to cost us. okay. so. too much. well, let's see. the. i like this. okay. all right. so. the top. i don't know if you guys can read that enough. i can't sit on my glasses on. but. so we've got the energy source. there's a four. so we have six categories. we have energy source electronics case. then we have case material supplements. interface type. and then button supplements. okay. so. first of all, energy source. we pick battery. and how many batteries do we think this will probably take? probably. so either two or four. two. like it. four is going to be too heavy. so that's not our problem. people can change it every month. they won't. excellent. they bought it. this is consumerism. all right. so. for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, events chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker. or a bunch of chip on print. that's the advanced chip on print. okay. we have one of those. okay. then the case is a probably it's double curved. case materials are plastic, plastic. i guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom. is that right or is it just one? oh, maybe it's one because of the single mode. you can do that. yeah. i guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero. which is the special color. that's not a special color. especially ugly color. interface type. we have push button scroll wheel interface. integrated scroll wheel push button and lcd display. so we actually have the lcd display. and then is it the integrated or? yes. okay. button supplement special color. special form. special material. we could of course make the buttons wood. same. how can they? really? or titanium. the cost is all the same. but we only have one button. so really we shouldn't be church. we shouldn't be churched anything. the button supplements. yeah. i think no. okay. we're going to leave that one blank because we run on lcd and scroll. so our total is 15.5. which i believe is by three euros over. so we go for the hand dynamics. so the only thing better than if a nana's shape remote is one that you shake. what if we complete and took out the one single button we've got on? and just had a scroll wheel interface. and the lcd display. i suppose the lcd display is the one that's putting out for that. yeah. well, because we have to have all of right. yeah. that's that's face it. it also depends on the software on the television. you can have the information of this in terms of it. and you can have the display on the screen. yeah, you could maybe take out the lcd display. even if it comes up on the computer itself, on tv itself. so we may not need the lcd display. no, it's possible. right. we may not need it. there you go. there we go. 12.5. okay. so we just remove our screen screen here. okay, a big a dial. easy to use. even easy to use on. besides, look at what the lcd does to our lovely remote. okay. back to the design room, boys. take away. i got a lot of. what's the blue part? that was just we got out of yellow. there you go. there you go. even simpler. looks more like a banana. yeah. those fruit lovers out there. okay. so costs under 12.5 euro. there's no. we redesigned it. yeah. now it's yes. next slide. project evaluation. project process satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, new ideas found. so i guess that. i think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me. but i'd like to hear your thoughts. kind of fill in some time. what did you think of our project process? yeah, i think we know quite well. yeah, right from the start of the day. yeah. we're just new where we were going to try to last. we started off a little, little week. and leadership was quite weak in the beginning. but as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing. room for creativity. there was that. i think we tried a lot of different things. i think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were doing. right on with a lot of those things. and you guys worked together. well, as a team. and the means. which was the whiteboard and the pens. i had some problem with the pen. i think. i have some powerpoint. yes. i'm not sure. no, i know. people have worked for. but the work. yeah. yeah. i have a list of employees that you would like fired. yes. okay. new ideas found. yes, for the remote. maybe no, not. technology. closing. coster within the budget. project is evaluated. and then we have a list of employees that we have. we have a list of employees that we have. complete final questionnaire and meeting someone. that's it. excellent. i still have to do my minutes. that's waiting. actually. so there will probably be another. question. and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can. what goes on after that. that's the end of our meeting.

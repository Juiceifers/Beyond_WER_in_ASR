 Okay. Oh, that's not going to work. Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. All right. As you all know, we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote. I'm Nick Tabusk. I'm the project manager. We'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are. And what you're doing, what your role is. Go ahead. Okay. I'm Corinne Whiting and I will be the marketing expert. And in each of the three phases, I will have a different role in the function design phase. I will be talking about user requirements specification. What needs and desires are to be fulfilled and I'll be doing research to figure this out. In the conceptual design phase, I will be dealing with trend watching. And I'll be doing marketing research on the web. And then finally in the detailed design phase, I will be doing product evaluation. And so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all of the requirements to see how we did. Okay. Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm the user interface designer. Likewise, I have three different roles for each stage of the design. The functional design is looking at the technical functions of remote control. In the concept design, the user interface, how the user reacts with the product. And in the detailed design, sort of like the user interface design, what they might be looking for, things like fashions, what makes it, how we're going to make it special. That's about it. I'm Manuel. And I'm the industrial designer in this project. In the functional design phase, I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements. We'll discuss what the product has to fulfill and so on and so on. My suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one. In the conceptual design, I'll be mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product. And the detailed design and the detailed design, I'll be concerned with look and feel of the product itself. Pretty much working together. Obviously on the design. Okay. So we've got our opening, our agenda is the opening acquaintance, which we've kind of done. Tool training, project plan, discussion, and then closing. So we have a grant of 25 minutes we have here. So we are putting together a new remote control. We want it to be something original. Of course, we're a not only a electronics company, but a fashion conscious electronics company. And we want it to be easy to use. We've got the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design, which basically is the three of you. And. Well, functional design. Do we have any ideas of maybe let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have. And then we can go into how we're going to design it and how we're going to do the detailing on it. Well, function remote control is just a change of channels as it's main function. So we wanted to be a TV remote or I mean, do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote? I suppose try and make it a university. Work on all electrical products in one person's house. But you know, they also have the same goal changing channels volumes and then programming. I think they all work on the same principle as well. I don't know. It's just in forget. I think yeah, yeah, universal remote. This is my first go around with creating remote control. I think we're all on the same boat here. One thing I thought over remote control is you always lose them. Okay. So those are the way of finding that quite easily. We should set our remote control up to where it has a tracking device or like a whistle. It makes a noise. There's a button on the TV that you press. Okay. Okay. So generally all remote was a sort of quite similar in their pains. Yeah. It's just long. So they're kind of like long and rectangular. Do we want something crazy? You know, we want something new that's going to stand out. I think modern. So our remote should be very close. Maybe like user friendly like a little. Yeah. You know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard. People I thought maybe because people always sent a third remote control about the place tomorrow. If it was a ball and actual controls inside or something. Well, there are of course certain restrictions. You can't have it be any form and fulfill all functions at the same time. So there are obviously some restrictions we have to apply here. However, one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that prefers to the material pretty much? What are we going to build the thing out of how sturdy is it going to be? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people? Whatever. Okay. So by one. Yeah. So we want to be sturdy. We wanted to hold up to somebody's child, you know, throwing it across the room or as you said, people kind of throw it. So ball shaped. You know, if it were ball shaped, maybe you can get a case on the outside and everything could be inside. Camp. So we want it to be modern, fun, sturdy. So we want to form in our function. We want it to be easy to find. What else. What else do we want it to do? So we want it to be universal. It's something that we're supposed to sell for about 25 euros. And, you know, goals for profits are, I think, somewhere around 50 million euros, what they want to make on it. So. Also, since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal. Okay. That's more on the research end, but the marketing. So marketing, you know, how maybe marketing you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there. Yeah. Maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences. Okay. Because maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting. Okay. Um. You guys have any ideas for what it should look like. Maybe we could draw it up on the board over there. Some ideas. We want to be a ball. I'll drop the ball and maybe where the buttons are located. For my original idea was just simply.

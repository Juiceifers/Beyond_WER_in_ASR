yeah i i so this was that face to face meeting but it it does not okay there is not th so there are things in the eye tracker record that we definitely do not want in the g_d_f_ format like the frame rate eye movement you know we we i we are if we are expecting the g_d_f_ format to be sort of a parsed version of events and you know there is just too much raw frame f frame rate stuff coming out of this you would not prob you would not want it in this kind of format for uptranslation to the other things yeah we yeah you can get back to it yeah we are not throwing anything away this is just the stuff we can get back to it we can get we can always get back to it we are not th actually throwing anything away and if we decide to rejig yeah yeah but the th but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyse against the other tracks of data so the data that we wanna compare with a language or with whatever and so of filtering so h h h h okay yeah s so in essence what you would then do is okay so whatever we should well we are not doing frame rate at any frame for well maybe we are i do not know i i had thought we were yeah the eye tracker does but you know th well the eye tracker does five hundred hertz though yeah but right w what w the kinds of events that we had r before talked about putting into the record for then use in elan and n_x_t_ is not based on saying every x_ seconds something you know give me give me what is happening every x_ seconds it is more like you know give me the fixations and the the blinks yeah oh yeah durations are in there but it is not there is a difference between saying that something is in a particular state every frame whatever the frame rate is you know ten seconds a minute you know that is that is one kind of w way of looking at data and a parsed version of the data which is not at any particular length it relies on this really close frame rate that is underneath well you need well one needs to know the duration of these things right so one needs to be able to say h h well so there is no real time no no the time the time is still in there but you will get what you want is to figure out what are the the concepts behind that data that you want represented so rather than saying the eye was at this particular place you know here and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here you say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blink from this time to that time and here okay so okay the eye h right so there is two issues here we are not throwing anything away but the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data would you be so the more you can plan kind of data h s so typically h so yeah this landmark h it is so you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation h yeah because okay so the percentage is i i is a cut it is not something you are using for measurement it is a cutoff for whether or not it counts as a fixation is that well that is or something so h okay h h so they will be right yeah yeah that cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after ra address all that h but but yeah the scan okay can we draw it to make sure that that that this is satisfying ellen is concerns as well yeah yeah so i did have it somewhere well there is a whiteboard right we love this thing see if the pens work so this is a_ is eyes right and b_ is eyes and i think what you are saying you should probably draw this right is that they you know if from this time to this time they are looking at triangle one have not brought it trying to remember it w what you are saying is that you want to know in the critical you wanna know after they are they are looking at triangle one what is happening in this period with this guy right h okay h right h h h alright h next yeah so yep h a target alright so yeah because so you know he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one is going to overlook lap quite a bit so what you want to do is be able to define bigger periods which is the period when they are sort of interested in triangle one overall right this is sort of some meta level analysis right h when they should be right m m yeah yeah yeah yeah h yes so we yeah so we if we have an an yeah but that is that is not a something that you can do in the n_x_t_ query language but it you cannot do that in any you know this is such special purpose s but it is easy enough given the data format for any of these things to do that so you could do it on cause i it is just a matter of i the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you wanna pull out because you know algorithmically you are you are already putting together i mean this is essentially already you know these fixations with stuff in between okay that should i i right yeah h and you know we we have got an algorithm for deciding when that is a look i guess you already have that or no h well well oh yeah yeah so it is all fixations they are these are all fixations and saccades but within the yep so that is easy enough so the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here right and you know maybe even having fixations on other things yeah right what yes yes yeah yep h yep intention is to back and forward yep so this is not yeah but what you need to do is we we can already build into this g_d_f_ format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is but i think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in some tool and play around with the definitions because you will not get it right the first time yeah and forth right and we should be able to to figure that out yeah sure so h h yeah h and elan is a reasonable choice for that right what you need is something well no because you need to events so to y you need to be able to see the effects of this so i g i guess this is a case of craig writing some scripts so robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying you know add this data a automatically it i mean it is not that hard right it is just there will be a bunch of these you will have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and w whether the other object is the existing construction or not right and so right so so essentially do not know yeah ah right so if they if they they had a fixation on c_ you would not be worried but if they had a fixation on well no i mean we would take yeah they are yep but yeah they are going to look at the clock and they are going to look at they may look at completely irrelevant at if the other is looking the same place they are in good shape yeah sure sure and that is what the other stuff that is what the h h but yeah expect but that is like a separate analysis right so sure it is a separate analysis it no no the so every separate right so so you can define if yeah alright h say alright for this phase it is t_r_ one or c_ for this phase it is yeah s_q_ but what we find e what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level right and then it is a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want so this is one we had not thought of adding before but we should right which is well how would you decide whether something was the current addend the cu okay h h you have so that is a han decision yeah on yeah yeah absolutely h yeah but the ex asse that well once you have but we believe emailed me but we believe j_p_ to be defining that maybe i w i will bring this one back to him yeah okay h the tasks i could believe them yeah no taking an interest in that yeah i mean the general division was language here and other stuff there right right right h i will just i will just minute that what well we but we have the now actions i mean actions well i do not know but oh yeah eye tracker here yeah i mean we know that about gaze right yeah i right but yes h yeah right so well yeah but i mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i y you would not consider it verbal analysis exactly it would be verbal plus action because it is a task breakdown it is just a segmentation well i mean what you know it is it is it is a task yeah but you would not have you you would not do two codings for task level one you would not do transaction coding in a action segmentation or that we are finished with the old one no you would not but i mean one of the things one of the things you would i i do not think that is realistic because i think what you would actually do is use the full record of what you have and do a segmentation i think it would be hard to understand what was going on if you used like just the language without watching the video to decide whether we are breaking down the task the thing which you guys thought to make in a paper oh you do not want it to be coding th based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things i mean this the language events are multimodal right you know they are they are doing all these things together well they wha why do you care whether they can do it just based on the the language is and say when do they stop and start because well it seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data but i you know i it is a possibility we will it is saying we are done with that and but this is but we have not looked at data like this it is h yeah well i c i can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both it is more g i cannot quite see why it is important to know that they can do it just based on the language when w you know that they had both h h h because you know it is a selfcontained h well i think that one is just bound to fail but yeah okay usually the claim almost all studies on really okay anyway alright i said that is the claim and so so back back to this main problem which is yeah w the record that we are getting in the first instance is about the m about these you know they are looking at some region of the screen defined dynamically and then we need some way of knowing what the you can you can see adding these other analyses about you know they are they are jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what s percentage of time they are looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the elan track or n_x_t_ they are they are both sort of track based in this way h h h but the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that and i i think in the first instance what we are trying to get into the g_d_f_ format is just this and then we have got no option but to figure out a way for like to look at this just explore this data suggest ways about doing it and be able to play them back and see when we think we have got these things right i do not think we even know what the set of these things are that we want much less how to get em yet so th no no and we will not and h yeah that is right so this is not the you know this is something we are aiming for but this is not something that affects what craig programs for the initial g_d_f_ translation you know fine my you can we can announce now yeah so let us just return to this question of frame rate because this is the thing we were not planning to transfer into this format so again you know what a frame rate kind kind of coding is ag it can again be seen as a track but it says it is a coding like this right where you say it is in state a_ state b_ state c_ state a_ that is all every single frame well okay but right so you right so i am just you are happy that it is not going to have frame rate like this it is going to have an interpretation like this beneath our level of analysis s well h well what does that mean sorry i c right the all events w right but it seems to me it seems to me that ellen is concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because you know this thing in itself is th bunch of fixations right with saccades or it is you know it is twenty milliseconds more than that one that is h but y y y you mean to the tags of the data w within it yeah so so yeah fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover you might want a and okay h can be so nber of fixations percentage of okay i am i am asking you as an expert this is this fixations no no this is this is still smary data they are he is we are talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the nber of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one right so y it is possible alright h as opposed to out of location h h i mean presably yeah the spots will be different anyway cause i you are not going to g have the same pixel so we have the option that we can put in an a_ fixation thing here right as well if you want the smaller if you want the smaller coding in in here so that it is not just parsed into this idea of which object but you also have the raw fixation data we can put that in as another track if you think that that is something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other oh ok okay so it is a jiggle rate okay right h well the nber of different yeah yeah h yep exactly so h i mean to yeah i d that is all he asked for yeah well i think of each fixation inside yeah it yeah if if we have got yeah and in n_x_t_ there is no cost right because the y the you just do not choose to load those all we are doing is dping it as output that you can load if you choose to i g s you know so if they are things that you just know are crazy and you are not going to want then we do not do it but otherwise we go ahead and dp em cause it is easy to dp out the fixations yeah okay right so it is the or right h yeah okay so it is the nber of fixations the did you want the you well actually do you want the average duration or do you want the nber of different ones but m not e well if it is each you have to d you have to break it down into another tier right you cannot you can say there were three fixations and they averaged a certain time but you do not wanna well the the average should be yeah d well what about the the overall s of the durations is that i mean which way do you want to well you have already got that with the the well if you have got the nber of fixations yeah then that is that is the way you want it that way around can then just generate it yeah okay so that is a measure and y did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this nber you can have as many of these as moving again that that should be yeah well it is not the the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high so you know it saves you i having to do write scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are nbers that are going to be useful to you okay what is from right h does this yeah and i do not know so h well well but y those are different tracks of information so what you want is one track of information about which object it is one one about whether or not it is on the other guy is gaze and one about whether it is on one of the mouse positions right we treat those layered cause you get c cause you yeah but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody is mouse somebody is gaze and some object right so if we h ye h yes as opposed yeah so the these are independent so so what we want is whether they are looking at s at the other person is gaze right and say they are in this period well i mean they are probably not given what i have trying to right and you want to know those things right they are i they are independent dynamic objects okay so a definition of we are all looking at h yep h h and h and b_ yeah so g so there is there is a lot of tracks here right because well we just added this fixation track okay right and then there is a_ is mouse not their eyes is on an object right and the mouse might be on triangle one love the eraser h yeah but the mouse is also a dynamic but it does not matter i mean i the mouse we are just saying where is the mouse you know it is on this object and then a_ is eye is on well a_ is mouse i guess right a_ is eye might be looking at a_ is mouse here that is fine okay h a_ is eye might be looking at b_ is mouse here right i mean these are all the different ways of taking crossproducts at the things that could be colocated so you just treat em as independent and i am guessing from what you say yeah i guessing from what you are saying you want all these tracks yeah which is fine there is no problem with that at all h right and then you then you look for combinations of them yeah i think we need to because tha some measure of alignment is looking yeah and the s so you kinda got the idea here yeah yep yep okay yeah so but the important thing is you do not treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive it is just so tha the objects is like a separate level of analysis if whether they are looking at the objects than whether they are looking at the gaze cause they can happen at the same time so yeah that actually true be cause right but that it is also going to h does that happen oh right around them h h okay or in okay so what you are saying is like a new problem for us which is i am going to change h h two objects that is the bad one left edge of one and the yeah so you are saying yeah okay can you write on my pen pad just say yeah pens yes pens new pens whiteboard pens so you are saying you know they could be looking at square one at this point cause they whiteboard pens i confuse em close together close together that their okay that is a problem for the data models and either of the things that we were using h h what do you mean by greatest overlap the greatest overlap with what draw my g my spacial reasoning is no good see i i am the one that uses the whiteboard cause i actually put the the microphones on throwing information away put these things on yeah this is the better pen is h yeah but you had a way of choosing which one right but so you just mean which i is it closer to the is the circle i mean what is this circle they are looking at a pixel or something right well that is th we right the gaze will wobble circle s right oh so those vary in size yeah yeah h that is going to be w it is it is not just a single point it is it is a it is h and so there will yeah they could be d or deciding which one to choose could just be oscillating oh but what pain that is going to be analytically because it is going to how many parts are there like way to do it well each one is yes or no yeah well the well whatever okay i know ways of getting around this analytically but th but sa but thing is if if we if we got if we got tracks for each for each part cause you c yeah i mean later on if they are really close to each other it is going to get foxed yeah okay if the regions i h if they are really close yeah it is not the data format i am worried about it is the the way you do the analysis because you do not wanna have to say you know did they jointly look at triangle one okay did they jointly look at square one okay did they jointly look at you know you need some way of going over the whole thing but i c we can find ways around that i think for now we we do it this way and then we we think about what we need out of it in the end it is just you know in elan it that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalistic way of of uptranslating to elan there will be a zillion tracks and it will probably ruin their viewer cause you will get very sparse data on each track it will be like the old referring expression generalis visualization the map task you know where they talk about one object one landmark and then another landmark well it is big right possible object of gaze h s a thing h well okay so h h h h i always thought that was brilliant yeah h well the well we will see if elan likes it or not yeah yeah and we b we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the n_x_t_ uptranslation a list of parts it it affects the way we do the n_x_t_ u uptranslation and make things easier for people and listen to them scream with parts right so i mean so yeah yeah well the the the the does not really list well the problem and it suddenly becomes and there could be more than one construct at a time right it is there is no the construct right of a sudden it ceases to exist cause you can build subassemblies and then you can start again yes and it becomes construct or assembly whatever two no you yeah oh it up and then link what why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it because yeah oh and this is because we do not want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct it is not a construct at all it is just a one thing and we do not want triangle one to suddenly have bigger stuff h well the problem is that all of these yeah yeah yeah there are there are yeah wai w i th the the yeah the con the con the constructs are already h okay yeah that was the next question i had yeah yeah construct oh yeah yeah it is h that will cover most of em which is coon to both of them h we pick i yeah it is triangle two for triangle one h yeah if if you take it if you t if you crea if you create you do not because that is you would have to have han coding to do that yeah there might be multiple triangles that you have broke and you will not know which one they are planning on using it for n n w yeah i mean the we e well you know which mold they come from and so you know which shape they match but you cannot possibly know which one of the ones they are meant to replace okay oh so there is no two parts with the same shape now yeah the then same shape oh same shape and colour right okay same eye yeah yep oh okay so you can tell what it is meant to replace then because it is the same it is just a case of the mold right right one two and three they yep day yeah but the this also but but that is hard h construction h for a yeah h yeah yeah so yeah yeah so i think that anything is loading there is there is then two yeah we in when you specify these things do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on so is this hardwired into tim is program or is it just an artifact of the way we s h in the new parts as far as i know it is hardwired right okay h so so it is hardwired polygon many mo so minor modification needed for box but what what what but what you can do h but what were the req wha if it that does not already exist cause i am tr i am has multiples yeah has has h yeah but they do not have enough to make unique h so what so when you say yeah that is how the h so i th there are five i think we have gotten to the point where you know to try to smarise we we think tim is program can do both of these conditions that you want but i am still worried about what the effects are for analysis because you were aiming at something in the g_d_f_ format and i was not quite sure what and w know okay okay so okay so w h yeah so so okay so i will smarise what we said about that part that every time you cast off a new part from a mold or you know every black triangle has a different i_d_ and you know it is a black triangle cause you know which mold it came from but you do not know which part it was intended to replace on the screen because you cannot mindread when is triangle one not triangle one anymore does it s keep its identity identity yes h that is yep what do you mean define h i cannot talk right i think that this is a han coding that is part of the action coding because i do not see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time do you think the f when the final yeah but that is okay cause they all have different underlying part nbers and when you say what a construct okay okay and you can no no no that is a definition wherein a construct yes yeah cause there is h okay yeah so we can easily look at things like that automatically it is just the why they g why they get new parts that is the problem for us we cannot if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we do not know we cannot know why until they do something with it if they do okay h yeah we have not h oh yeah you said that yeah there there are a yeah but you can faint so you see but you can break you you can but you can break one when you break one you do not cast off the mold yourself it happens automatically oh okay never mind then b you have to break one to get one okay yes yes i i it appears so they just have to use it yeah suddenly the th th the new h oh but they have to drag it up past the mold line yeah it is there yes they have to h yeah where there is extra parts h the the baufix the yeah stock okay so this why question does not even arise because there there is a so you so so you appreciate h cause you know what they are going to do with it when they decide to move it past the mold line they are p doing something with it probably and you will know what they are going to do with it because screwing up h yeah they do it by the time by yeah that is right you will so you will how would you do that intentional yeah but there is there would be no way of coding that automatically right how could you possibly do that but that is a han coding right yep so you c h h the so w not generically so that is going to particularly be a problem for j_p_ right remember m all the things we are looking at are f with language with and without language and it is going to be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language which means it is probably not what else do we need to know unless they develop a convention yeah okay but th this is properly part of the action coding so we should well we should make a wish list right as a side effect look you know let us do it like this sure absolutely i just i just wanna make sure that a wish list yes yes yeah it i although they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it yeah yeah h or i do not think that is very good no we will never y yeah but that is bringing in the the language thing again yeah yeah h just throw that no no it was them just dr forgetting to define an attribute they had to alright yes it was something that had to be defined well whi which is probably a docentation fault right oh so was actually their their fault but yeah i mean i am yeah so yeah exactly is there a y yeah well while we are on past things is there anything else you wanna tell us about the prior part of this which is the you know what else is he holding you up from there will not be any crazy scores anymore h but right so it does not slow down the eye tracker it does not do anything nasty so we we p so we pay for it and nothing we can tell no yeah no no the the the there is there is very small nothing important and noth nothing big enough they are going to look at it right no yep yeah o only the other guy is gaze to the other person yeah yeah i know oh do you need two copies of camtasia to do that generated so you are going to look into this right well y c look at the licence conditions it might not because it will be two machines i c i never prejudge licences until i have read em so well and hold on before we get go any further so this has implications for data storage right because w it means we have got well no this is three times right cause we have got oh no we are going to build we are going to use javascript to build the videos on the fly right cause it is fast so the the permanent storage is just the camtasia stuff so is that a problem where are we putting things h it cause it is now twice twice the size of a yeah oh we can we can put em in the same thing right really want to play them independently you can dp em into one video frame if you do not mind losing resolution but that is maybe a problem right because so the synchronization is going to be a problem yeah yeah before the task each task yes no they are they are so right and they are these are ba these are backups right so the flash get allows you to handsynchronize them later if you need to by stripping extra video off the front as long as you make sure you start em before the flash then you are fine but it will there is a a cost of having to go to backup which is synchronizing them right is there a div h h h know about the other one h yep yep long it took them actually oh okay so you so you should start the camtasia really early then that actually helps i mean that ni right true i well right okay on on doing that that is a a h file that is not where you are putting it i mean u camtasia thing well okay you have got the proper sound record but you are not dping it through camtasia to record it right you are it it is yep what before we were going to use camtasia at all what well what we were going to do what were we going to do with the sound h so ha wou is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through camtasia rather than running it out straight how good is it yeah have to really question okay so what you are planning on doing it is bunging it on one of the camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the camtasia track bit of it is an easy bit of yeah and then you are going to bung it on the other camtasia track too if you need it right but we will just we are going to store all three separately then and the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the camtasia videos but you will know when the real experiment you will know the relationship between that and the eye tracker timings and then then they can do sound analysis on that yeah no han intervention required it is timestamped yeah but ho hold on do we need that i mean it i i thought the way that tim had this set up originally the audio w the time stamps used there would be joint time stamps between the audio and the eye tracker so that you know the audio record ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we did not have to do any extra hand work you know any chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay yep so we are relying on your matlab script to get us the chopped version of the audio right right so we can either adjust the eye trai track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever however many seconds oh okay right so we so i just yeah yeah but but d the lining up the camtasia two is going to take we w he is working on a matlab script for the sound but not for so the one that is got the sound on it that will also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up the one that does not have the sound on it it will not right h oh so it is just got the bleeps oh okay so w no hand synchronization required at all as long as the scripts work right oh yeah yeah kay how confident are you about the finding these things so we just have to w hope we do not have an any subjects with the odd vocalizations right right right they they also yeah yeah i do not see him with ten he kilohertz yeah okay yeah yeah cause this this is the dropout test yep okay h yeah yeah yeah and the there is a signal a percentage oh yeah yes i know but so you g you got a solution for that then jack but it is a mono but it is a mono microphone mono mono recording on microphones oh right okay yeah a line in so it is a so it is a lit so you are sure there is not a better solution that involves yeah can we do cause you know people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something you never know if it is the data is there then yeah yeah i mean you know room which we yeah you know sound and you are going to want forced alignment we are d in good circstances oh no well no no better to collect and sort no no no do you have a yeah well it is the mono the the they wait wait w i i thought the sol that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket sound card right so low so you said the problem was the m it the m m i is expecting a mono microphone input that the line is stereo the so the sound the sound the s so is that fixable like is there any way yeah i think a new sound card sounds a better solution than monkeying about with trying to filter white noise out that is somewhere in the sound card and yeah a new sound card is fixable yeah which is not hard yep but hi but it is only got one input right so if so if i i if each machine recorded i believe it is easy to put two monos into a stereo signal yeah so well i am not the technical yeah oh they yeah and then the so the yeah so th yeah it is easy easy yeah yeah read file so is there any reason why we wou do not do that yeah yeah well it is in the old days we probably would have want a little if they would been in the same room we would have had a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well just to make sure cause it is slightly dicier you know if his scripts do not work then you do not get the overlap yeah okay h h yeah i wanna see several of them i wanna see it does not have to be a real trial it just has to be two guys talking in the two bits and then yeah yes that is right i just we have both been so badly bitten in the past i hear more choice language yeah but this this sounds reasonable to me i so i think so then yeah do do they both have the same sound card problem i would not count on it then we combine okay mentioning this to the oh the colour the well yeah i think tell the guys i think that is to yeah yeah h yeah h yeah it is just the way they wired it so it is getting late and i have got a two oclock and i have got a nice lunch so i wanna eat my lunch today what did you wanna get through today more i mean i think i think it was useful going through your expectations about this cause that is quite a bit clearer in my head at least and but i think mostly we leave you to go away and redesign the g_d_f_ or add new bits to the g_d_f_ along these lines and then w right okay okay h yeah i am yeah so and yeah yeah yeah there there is move but i think the thing to do is for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the the kinds of things we have added about whether they are looking at the other person is gaze and what have you and and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe oh maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something and the right thing to do is for us to look at the sp the spec the way you understand it now and some data and then ellen will have new ideas about what is needed or about these postanalyses you know the and then and we can add em in but it is going to emerge over time i mean that is clear right yeah so i am right s yep yep yeah yeah i will oh so the spec to the other conversation yeah the sound thing the sound yeah that is that is solved now yeah test we have to test h we think we believe right so that is that yep well you do not have your models or do you problems yeah yeah well anything you actually need fixed you know joe does not live here anymore right so well i but he was not going to be booking any time to us after the thirty first of october so that that means that any bugs that need fixed are now craig is responsibility right you do not know have any change on that right okay fair enough cause he that is what he said to us originally so i would asse you know no more contact with joe it is not fair to get work out of somebody for free so you know ask craig instead i have not i have not had any discussions with him since okay yeah ph he is i do not think our time in get well w he was not paid in advance he is being paid in arrears so it does not matter right i think it is but m he he he i think it is better to have all the software i mean it is not big things it is just maintenance at this program at this point and if the if i if it is a right but if yeah i if he can give it you know like because the problem is you gotta have an iediately when you discover a bug in that and we can make craig shift all his other priorities to do this cause we bought him right yeah so it is a kinder way it yeah fairly urgent h h right right but we cannot we cannot make joe do this ec alright so there is some tradeoff between availability yeah but it sounds like you do not think there is anything that actually needs fixed at the moment because w we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something and you got work rats so else is code so you know right so we are we are b we are building well yeah yeah and how many models do you need to completion and how long does that take we are we and you got and you know about complexity you are waiting on marloes you can cold call her today this afternoon h is that okay that is her job come on yeah yeah okay is the is this is this generalised is or do you have a specific okay yeah oh yeah she is using okay yeah so you can dash in there for half an hour at a time does not sound very useful for you h okay well you guys sort it out okay we have but we have we have a solid h own it right but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you are bped yeah had priority oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah h i thought that was the problem that your mornings were not sliced off on the booking system okay cause you know i if you are sa told use the booking system yeah just a well we yeah and what are the instr what are the people upstairs downstairs have i you know as rules about who you hand the keys to cause you know we like people to know to ground the oh i thought the the lending for the booking system caroline right well the two key holders are here oh i see see cause you are supposed to have training in i see but no they oh okay so that is the safety and you control those accounts oh okay that is fair enough okay on these machines so that they could book they could not actually log in h okay we are also h yeah that is safer cause then they learn the first time when you come off them because the it is the people have been leaving var well people yeah yeah okay i really have to get out of here so what else is important before you run okay nothing right piloting you got willing heads have to build the things we have to try oh i do not think i brought my diary up but maybe why i get a email okay so okay yeah h h so do you know what time of day you might want cause i should c i should check that okay you all have to b you will have to be there to when it falls over unle unless unless it is a bug report yeah i will w yeah w i will i will i will b i will yeah okay relax so so that all sounds f good fun well i can just leave you guys here you know why not yeah so which data you know i i want everything and then i will decide what i want okay uptranslation to the other things yeah we yeah you can get back to it yeah we are not throwing anything away this is just the stuff we can get back to it we can get we can always get back to it we are not th actually throwing anything away and if we decide to rejig this at some finer yeah but the th but the way to mecha method we will still have the original and a method of of filtering so analyse against h so h a language or with whatever and so yeah s so in essence what you would then do is well we are not doing h h okay as long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalised to a finer take because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you have done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly okay so whatever we should be able to b you know backtrack and say okay instead of every second every tenth of a second or some such thing but you know th i i had thought we were yeah well the eye tracker does yeah h yeah what is happening every well you need the blinks yeah oh yeah durations are in there but it is not well one needs to know the duration of these things right so one needs to be able to say whatever the frame h kind of h that is underneath well so there is no real time there is only ev there is only events what i am we are trying to figure out is whether we have thrown time away and then a tenth of a second here time and okay h right so there is two issues here we are not throwing anything away but the okay so one of the formats in which eye tracker data is analysed is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event okay so you actually have to be shu have to show at some time slice rate whether the eye was on the same target as the other guy a similar target what we would both been deali you know so we have to b we have all the parts the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time alright now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate but i think that is really unlucky but but my point is that we mustnt throw away in or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data h h yeah so the more you can plan h yeah h s so typically the eye will move right so over any one second they eye is actually f fixing on a bunch of different things and you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here what is going to happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate it is going to jiggle all over the place it is going to be on this landmark it is on this object that object this fixed thing that fixed thing okay you are going to get lots and lots of stuff and it is percentage distribution that you are going to want it is not i went here i s you know it is not like person walking i went here i stayed here it is it is more like a fly hovering yeah h because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events m m i i yeah h against bigger frames the c the c yeah is that well that is the that is the problem there are two ways of doing it one is that there is always a cutoff right but the other is that there will be a time span a kind of reaction to some event span h b m right i suppose h h h right and so i mean there are there are really two ways of looking at this one would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing okay and one would like to know sequences of they did not look at the same thing and then they broke it or they did look at the same thing and then they did or did not brea you know one one could imagine those two categories that is that is a kind of testing of our hypotheses but there is a certain amount of dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published and one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event right what percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking and what percentage of time over some you know reasonable time span of a couple of seconds alright so they will be they they will want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places so we have to be able to deliver those two things and they are rather different demands th th th right h h h h or how l alright let us let us imagine a typical construction event okay there is some part there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use right there may be or not a construction already begun right somebody makes the first move there is some kind of counication either gestural imaginary or verbal that plans how we are going to do it right before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning while they are speaking or counicating in some way the other person may or may not be looking where they are looking okay they may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest let us call it the c the construct existing construct which could be zero h h alright or the the addend the thing which is next going to be added next piece okay now in neither case when you draw this he is looking at triangle one which you are actually drawing you know for a the period of time in which he is steadily looking at triangle one is going to be very very short right because staring fixedly without interruption blink or or saccade is is an extremely short event h the it m it m but yeah so h alright that is fine so it is in a region it is in a region okay but even so you are likely to get bouncing in and out of the region right so even so you wanna look at if we are interested in how long before the construction move takes place how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing let us call that our measure of alignment so they are going to be yeah that is right a_ is going to be on triangle one and various other places that is right and and b_ okay and we are going to look at the percentage of of that time where they are both in the same region sort of gaze gaze time on that yep yeah that that is a target within the target region m h m yes somewhere h so right so what i want to make sure is that we do not simplify do you know what i mean temporarily simplify too much so that yeah it it sh yeah it i mean cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a d_v_ dif r yeah it there should not be anything missing yeah right and so b_ has some periods of looking at one and all it will which will also be intermittent because that should be alright yeah yep lap quite a right yeah yeah right this is sort of some meta level analysis h when they should be right so we yeah so we if we have an an event that is okay i and h well well if it is it a a so that is easy right what yeah yep back and forward yep yes yes because for example for part of that time both b_ and a_ are probably looking at the construct okay if if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed you would tend to look back and forth right h yep h this is not yeah but what you need to do and we should be able to to figure that out yeah h and yeah sure so so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events so h yeah and so ah right so so essentially there is there is a_e_ is divided into t_r_ one and c_ and other stuff okay where c_ is the construct the existing thing they had a fixation on yeah they are yep well no i mean we would take a separate we would look at the percentage time i mean i have no idea because i do not know how people look when they are building things together okay so there is a there is the addend and the and the co the existing construct and i do not know whether they are going to spend more time looking at one or the other but if they are whatever it is that one is looking at if the other is looking the same place they are in good shape and they are going to look at they may look at completely irrelevant h yeah yeah sure sure and that is what the other stuff that is what the that is what the diagonal stripes are for that is true but we c we can one of the things we will be doing is categorising people i take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock we would expect that if we put people under time pressure they will look at the clock a lot more h more h right so it no no the so every separate yeah h yeah but sure it is a separate analysis but you do not wanna throw it away right so so you can define if all of these things are actually categorised by the eye tracker as to where the eye is alright you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say alright for this phase it is t_r_ one or c_ for this phase it is s_q_ one or c_ okay easily h right and h cu so that is a han decision yeah you have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film further on yeah yeah absolutely h yeah yeah the g_d_f_ format right right yeah that is the addend in the construct should be you know kind of they they change their true identity but they are i their categories of stuff now i w my kind of assption was that that this was j_p_ land that that is what he was re what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence okay so and well he is really interested in are they looking at the construct does that sound does that sound reasonable yep yeah right but we believe but we believe j_p_ to be defining the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addend alright and and it was the negotiation of which candidate was going to be the right candidate that is actually the interesting stuff so i should talk to him about this he is he is actually emailed me with a l with a list of things he wants to discuss at length so i w i will bring this one back to him h so which one does h well this is my question for him is he going to define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out or is he so b i mean you know they have been working on construction there for a while so it may be that they have a coding system that is ready to go and we should just apply it h i could believe them yeah no okay they do a lot of subassembly in the tasks they have been doing so they may well have a yeah i mean the general let us find out other stuff there right i will just i will just minute that oh yeah eye tracker here yeah i mean we know that right right so wha right what well we but we have the now actions i mean actions might mostly be theirs right but since we have the the eye tracker i th we are going to have to answer their questions about gaze right yeah i right but so they will they will they will tell us something about that but presably what you piously hope is happens here is what happened with transactions right that the verbal analysis and the and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points the same chunking points h that is what i have understood it to be but well i do not know but w h h yes h yeah right it is a task breakdown it is just a segmentation yeah but you would not have you you would not well i mean what you know it is it is it is a task breakdown but for the verbal version there are ways of announcing that now we are doing a new one right or that we are finished with the old one you would not do transaction coding in a action segmentation i i do not think that is realistic because no you would not but i mean one of the things one of the things you would like to establish you know as an as an outcome of this is that you could analyse either end and you would get the same chunking of the material the thing which you guys thought to make in a paper it is a hypothesis i mean this well wha why do you care whether they can do it just they are doing these things together but one of the things that you one could imagine doing is sen is you know having the transcription there and pl just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates and say when do they stop and start is because because essentially you are looking at cycling sequences in discourse and if the discourse tells you what is going on that is information i mean i g one of the questions is how the information is going to be shared across these media and if you can get it all out of the speech you know if the if all of the chunking is available when there is speech well it seems to me much less important than okay then it is carrying a lot of the burden it is saying we are done with that and you know i it is a possibility we will yeah but this is but we have not looked at data like this with this with our oldfashioned analyses you know and i it is it would be really nice to know that that much information that chunking of the task information is being carried by the language because j_p_ is question the overriding question is so what is language for you know if people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues do not even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they are doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant cause language is irrelevant it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we are controlling whether you have language or not you could get the entire chunking of the task out of a language it is h without the language in cases h h it is more h know that they had both because you know it is a selfcontained system as opposed to a system which is which cannot be interpreted without the other system i think that one is just bound to fail but yeah okay usually the claim almost all studies on language claim that language is a selfcontained system which will give you everything you need to know that is the claim anyway alright i did not say it was true i said that is the claim and so it is worth testing problem h h this way h get em yet so th yeah that is right no no and we will not and establishing the full set will you know take us much of the project so you know yeah fine my only concern w you a as i said when i barged in was just to make sure that we did not lose the things that we might need to pick up later that is all it is a coding like this every single frame in state well a_ right so you right so i am just you are okay but since the l the definitions of look a thing we are looking at are d are the ones which get rid of the lower level like jiggling around in the area of a particular object right so if we are moving the the green triangle we have defined a region which is the dynamically the green triangle wherever it is we will jiggle around in there but it does not matter where we are in there that is beneath our level of analysis s h h well well the in that interpretation is definable to frame rate by our by the only way we are going to use frame rate right w right but it seems to me it i c well i mean i because i can i can say for how many frames this fixation went is officially defined so that as long as i as long as it is not a untimed event okay a and an end time so it is you know it is fine i can say it is a long one or it is a short one or it is you know it is twenty milliseconds more than that one that is yeah all all the all events have a start time and an end time so yeah saccades h so h can be so nber of fixations percentage of and okay i am i am asking you as an expert this is this this is not a leading question this is a question question why would that be informative particularly h the h around h rather than just on it so you think that if for example if they are looking at one or another apex of a triangle it would just that would make a difference they were exploring the thing as opposed to they were simply alright there is it there it is okay so th so that really means that we are not throwing away absolute fixations longer on it yeah it yeah it is it is certainly it is it is worth h the screen location of absolute fixations want to throw out the nber of fixations alright looking so y it is possible h as opposed to out of it so you so i thought i understood you to mean exploring the figure because you know your fixation is a point and the figures are bigger than points so you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it i mean presably okay alright fine the because you would then have to break up so you just want to know the variability of the of the fixation and would not that differ from person to person somehow yep h yeah the spots will be different anyway cause i you are not going to okay so it is the nber of different spots within that region where the eye has fixed the nber of different fix oh ok okay so it is a jiggle rate okay th w i i would say just the nber of fixations i mean it could just be yeah the nber of different yeah yeah right so you want h other yeah i d that is all he asked for yeah well all i th understood you to ask for was the duration of each fixation inside yeah it yeah you can come back you i okay we go right yeah so it is the nber of different fixations the did you want the you well actually do you want the average duration or do you want the nber of different ones but m duration of each fixation in the region of the fixation i mean which way do you want to well you have already got that well if you have got the nber okay so that is a measure of jiggle in the region roughly view of this moving if okay right to you what is our error of measurement on location on the screen so to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes little circles are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region that right okay but if we are building in right h it will it is yeah okay right if what you have i is a sort s b okay so my question was going to be alright the the mouse is a dynamic object right the eye track is a dynamic object or is it only the the piece that the eye tra the other person is eye track is on that is that is an object in this definition yeah is a is an object okay with some with plus or minus something or other yeah around it some circular area okay and as well h yep trea treated the same as as the mouse say yep h yes yep h so you can be on the object but not on the other person is gaze so there can be a triangle which has a_ is gaze in the centre and your gaze actually happens to be here you are in the triangle region does this yes so if there if h yes but okay looking but it is directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap right like this h yeah h h it is triangle h but so i do not know well well h h h well it would come up it would say yes right i mean because they would be in the same place so if you y you are going to have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition if the mouse is on the construct then right right the h h the m the mouse the gaze and the part are all an eye at the same time okay okay yeah yep yeah yeah you want right positions yeah but i in in the analysis you should we treat those as as other objects but the difference between them and the the parts of the c thing to be constructed is that they are allowed to overlap with other things so nothing breaks okay if we h they can ye right so yeah so the these are independent so so what h yes as opposed to simply looking at somebody is gaze when the mouse is not also there right and you want to know those things right they are i they are independent dynamic objects h yep they are probably not given what i have trying to h h h yeah okay so a definition of we are all looking at and touching the same thing so imagine that we have just added a piece to the construct alright so now that is the construct and both mouse symbols are on it right and both gazes are on it right so at that point you should have a lineup of a_ is on the construct a_ is on the mouse a_ is on a_ is on a_ is mouse a_ is on b_ is mouse a_ is on b_ is gaze and b_ likewise okay yeah yep because right and then there is ooh i love the eraser and the mouse might be on triangle one h yeah but the mouse is also a dynamic object but it does not mean i the mouse that is fine okay h are all the different h colocated right i am guessing from what you say yeah i and then you then you look for combinations of them yeah yeah which is fine there is no problem with that at all yeah i think we need to because tha some measure of alignment is looking where the other guy is directing attention and there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track one is where the mouse is and the other is where the gaze is so h h these right right right h at the mouse but the important thing is you so the objects is like a separate level of analysis if whether they are looking yeah that actually true be cause h cause they can happen at the same time right but that it is also going to be the case that whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square okay what do we do about that yep oh right h yeah because if you have them close together there is always some fuzz factor around them and so if they are left lying close together okay or in the in fact in the model in the not in the model in the in the supplies set they are actually neatly packed into a little space if when they get moved together h it h is h h and they are okay can you write squeak squeak yes saying they need some new pens say yeah pens whiteboard pens whiteboard pens close together okay because the two are so close together that their regions overlap were h h greatest overlap the greatest overlap with what well ho ho position and see i i am the one i think i think you are throwing information away i yeah but it may be a bad idea it may be a bad idea you have just thrown data away yeah just if this is there is more of it yeah i yes yeah yeah j i am saying is if they are looking well thing is that with you just mean well right the gaze will wobble the gaze will wobble that is natural circle and area yeah so i i it it yeah yeah h it is a yeah they could be or indeed they might be looking from one to another d or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you do not want to decide it is only one and throw the other one out or b yeah they could just be oscillating h yeah thing thing is h actually oh but what okay well that is fine that i was going to say that is the obvious way to do it so going to how many parts are there like well each one is yes or no couple of dozen well the well the the the it depen depends on the right different parts okay six to a dozen usually but th but h it down you c yeah i mean i think it is very likely that if people are considering f h h i mean if if they are oscillating though then on if they are really close to each other it is going to get foxed well not if the regions overlap okay if the regions i when you decide they are looking there h if they are really close right and if you define the regions so neatly that there is that you know that we are losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it is in the middle of space then h h yes yeah it is not the data format i am worried about it is i mean i i actually like the solution however ugly it it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every possible object of gaze yeah well the jointly h going over the whole thing but i s a thing h i think for now we well okay so there will h it will h one object one landmark and then another landmark well it is big right well we will see if elan likes it or not yeah and we b we better also h h i always thought that was brilliant yeah it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see what is going on but it gives you a very clear picture of what is going on yeah well okay but so we would we would better do a test one and and listen to them scream the yeah of parts with parts u uptranslation and make things easier for right so i mean so yeah well the the the the does not h you got an i_d_ okay so what about the point where a part becomes the construct do you still identify it as a part i mean i think one should lose that i take it cause the th yeah the but but well wha wha what happen what happens there is that the h h cease right part so you cha so every time a part is added to the construct it becomes a new part so the construct actually has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing okay so if there is just the initial thing you have put it in the middle of the screen that is just the initial object right soon as you put a part there is a construct but it is construct one because when you add another part construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two right so actually defining all of those as the construct is going to be the trickiest thing h yep yeah and it suddenly becomes right so you are you are looking at triangle one right and all of a sudden it ceases to exist if you cannot cannot chop it off h and then it yes and it becomes construct or assembly whatever there is no the construct right cause you can build subassemblies and then you can start again also when you when you screw it up you g start again no you can build sub subassemblies and then link the the part really yeah yeah because the definition yeah that that that that is what that is want triangle h bigger stuff well the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence so do we know the difference between we broke it and it went away and it is now part of the construct yeah can we ta can we tag the constructs with what is in them are there yeah th con the con the constructs okay so we could we could essentially well then we could culati or it is a new construct cause it has a new list of a new culative list of parts right but we will came together to make that construct yeah but you can still ta you can right so so you can still so some fancy prograing is going to have to be done to say i was looking at triangle one and now i am looking at triangle one in construct one cause the first construct was triangle one and square one okay yeah yeah but but that is easy alright so now we have to ask whether things that construct it so l let us imagine this we have made a construct of two parts and we are c i a triangle and a square and we are considering now adding something on to the side of the square that is not attached to the triangle okay are we looking at the square or we looking at the construct i had yeah in this definit should be looking at the construct there is not a way to figure out that you are looking at the square rather than the triangle way it is dis defined yeah yeah h at the construct it is it is well i can h that will cover most of em h i yeah okay because i mean that is that is the example m f presably that is the best example of overlapping overlapping areas cause if if the thing the two s the two things are now abutted of course there is an area which is coon to both of them okay so what i am trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between something going out of existence cause it is joined to construct something going out of existence cause we threw it away right suppose we pick up an we we we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we did not like it and we took another one is it triangle one is it triangle one prime or something like that it is the replacement for triangle one h yeah if if h create a new well how do i know what it replaces out of the parts bin be multiple n n w the we e this is true but if i have triangles one two three right and i throw them away any triangles i take out are to replace one two three you okay except that ex no you do not know which one they are meant to replace but you know they are not meant to replace any that are all that are that have not been thrown away okay they cannot you know whi you know which way they match so you can oh so there is right so the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen and if there is no more t_r_ one track the t_r_ one track is gone now yes they ca they can appear without them you c yeah oh there are many oh same shape same identity colour same eye oh is that true you have decided not to make all the triangles red and squares green and well that is well that is that is what they are oh oh okay then because it is the same it is just a case of the mold right one two and three they okay so th that is that is so there tim is so shape plus colour okay are individual they are unique all the parts are unique so wai hang on that makes the task a little bit easier right colours for the yep unique yeah yes yep the all the lines so h yep it is just a construction indeed which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier does not it this also h h but but that is hard to code i mean that is really a thing we might do okay so now let us make sure that the coding would survive that it is just it is a beautifully controlled situation the construction task is essentially the same it is the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple for a just to choose a colour at random here h yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah so i think that anything is loading there is there is then two h h h in the new so if you have five black triangles there going to be five black triangles in the parts box or one so h box h in the h can reuse h h then but what were the req wha has multiples yeah okay as long as it this is possible so c that that just is a kind of thing which is so simple so much like a single one zero variable change that it if it that does not already exist cause i am tr i am trying to kinda map this onto baufix and baufix has has multiple you know all the the yep h yep same same pieces h h the the v the nuts are are red or and all the flat things are wood colour something no so they they can have the same part the same part is different colours oh yeah that are different colours but same part in different colours yeah yeah h so i th i so when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then there will be lots of them lying around and i think that is how the robot is set up to there are five five green bolts here is one you know h that you want but i am still okay okay so h and w yeah so so okay so i will smarise what we said okay so w all i am i am doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that we will miss by th a simple view of for example regions and looking at at triangle one when is triangle one not triangle one anymore does it s keep its identity from identity yes you h that is true so how can we define the shapes that people build well if assing i was for a moment i was j_p_ and i wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing h okay and i wanted to to look at the strategy and i wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever i mean suppose i cannot talk to you and i am doing this task with you and i cannot talk to you i the thing which is going to be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you i can reach for the next thing and you can go where i reach but if i have some you know subgoal some longterm subgoal of doing something clever with putting these together cause it is hard and then putting these together cause it is hard there it is going to be almost impossible to convey that to you and the difference in the history of construction right is an important thing and i wonder how we can get that information back part of the action coding because do you think no it why is not that is that is not the question i am asking the question i am asking is what is the history of the construct so you have the n the names of the things in there and you have two constructs suppose we have two subconstructs and whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier nbered of those constructs right how do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct yep you have got okay it is it is it is parent child relationship yeah but that is okay cause they all have different okay so construct two could b construct one is a red triangle and a green square construct two is two green squares okay construct three right is a red triangle a green square and another red triangle construct four okay you say what a construct no no no okay and you can so how are we going to tell when for example you think we are going to have to do han coding on when two subconstructs are put together no that is a definition wherein a construct has a c has constructs as children yes okay action okay you are taking together right h so we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the all the interactions in which people build subconstruct contstructs first which we expect them to do bu as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal counication than when they do not okay and we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children children of that construct look at okay h they suddenly h they do yeah we have not actually made a rule that you cannot collect extra parts right but you can break you you no no i mean you have to b you have to break one to get one okay until yes and you cannot just bring extras in case you screw up you have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra no nope that yeah that that is yeah where there is extra parts h h h we i asse the the baufix the there are not any extra parts and i but it does have replacement allow for that yes replacement but no yeah h you cannot have okay so this why question does not even arise because h there there is a so you so so you appreciate you appreciate the cost of extra parts that it will never use h h what they are going to screwing up what they are h they do by the by yeah h that is right right okay so they rejected something or they broke something inadvertantly okay is there a way of yeah h so you will so you will know what they are replacing so telling the difference between intentional and unintentional breakages bec yeah them into no you p they both put they both put their hands on a construct because they do not like it can idea that they bring a but but that is h you yep so that just has to be coded there is no h that so w not generically because they will if they are going to do it by gesture they will build up a convention right yep that is going to particularly be a problem what else do we need to know it is probably not yeah okay but th this unless they develop a convention suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look you know let us do it like this yeah so we should well we should make a wish list right as a side effect sure absolutely i just i just wanna make sure that a wish list yes yes although what i am trying for sure you know that is and l or well n is not necessarily intentional they could just screw up yep no they could just make a mistake or screw up yeah and and then one guy does it yeah yeah h h or i do not think that is very good no we will never get away with that we will get a bad score let us just throw that away and start again yeah y yeah but that is bringing in the the language thing again h h yeah okay which reminds we have fixed the score problem have we right the percentage yeah was the percentage overlap and that made the score is fine yeah that is when i left oh yeah well do you know which which which which one was the top right yeah h ye that is that is the way it is worked out but the problem was to do with the m the p they had a relative and absolute piece and but that is all been fixed that is that is that is back so as long as it is defined fine yes it was not yep no no it was them just dr do not tell me it was a feature well they had alright be defined well whi which is oh okay oh so so that was it was actually their yeah yeah i mean i am h yeah in the docentation but like yeah the right and a long page so yeah is there a y yeah well while we are on past not prominently flagged okay a counication flaw okay so we can now that is now just lovely and there will not be any crazy scores anymore if you do not know about it yep exactly yeah yep but h oh i have to use a new page with it but alright so the last i think i am sorry you know i had as assorted emails from you and i was probably did not catch everything the problem was that there are two camtasia records yes there will no yep yeah they do not see their own gaze they see the o only the other guy is gaze right feedback they do not see their own gaze to the other person so h h you mean officially okay i mean do not know do not know if it is check out okay so we i i will have a w h cause it is now oh we can we can put em in the same thing right is there is there such a thing as you know dual track video because you can certainly mix things what ideally one wants one does not really want to l to have these things because we are using them for backup and for coding we do not really want to play them independently we do almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel time aligned h h h h what are we doing for synchronization otherwise during okay so that we would have to realign them we could not dp them from their start points well maybe you could the thing that you are dping them onto just starts running with the flash and the bleep you turn on the two copies whenever at different times but they are still no is the what what i th what are they i do not really understand the the parts that are operating here two videos are turning on there is no time stamp that comes from some coon source yes camtasia y yeah but no h and right it starts recording so right okay and they are they are totally separate they do not the flash get allows right is there a div stripping h you are fine h yep them h so they will include things like the the eye tracker calibration right which is not a bad thing actually because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject right yeah and hand every time we recalibrated the damn thing slipped yeah yes yeah see how how long it took them actually that is that is true how long did it take them to calibrate or yeah how many t how many times before so you so you should start that actually helps i mean that ni i then right yep well it h right no they that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody is data smooth out when it will not because yeah that is a technical term that is a a technical categorization in psychological research it is done first h you go back and actually yes they were crap is not that the answer yeah and that is because well we need sound we we need real sound recording right that is that is two track that is stereo it would it be worth splitting it yeah so the at at alright finally h into a stereo on w on what sorry the on one on one of the con p_c_s o o it is or m that is not where you are putting on camtasia thing that is our only sound record yeah we h is there how good is it about from putting this through yeah have to really question h exactly the same then you are going to bung it on the other camtasia track too if you and then then they can do sound analysis on that right so we can either adjust oh okay so i just however many seconds right so we there is going to be a way to sooner or later to align the eye track camtasia one camtasia two with two sound channels right the one that h oh so it is just ah the bleep we will find finding these things them it so we just have to right yeah right right they they also tend to have a funny funny shape beeps so yeah i do not see him with ten he kilohertz h cause this this h yeah yeah yeah is there an end signal when you decide it is all over does it ping you back and yeah the the the there is a signal right okay so when you have when you have pressed we are finished it pings back at you okay so yep yep it is just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you are running things and so up saving a percentage of a trial is sometimes a good i you know being able to do that is sometimes a good idea okay can w involves cause you yeah can we do can we do something better than that like having or something yeah then you know yeah and you are going to want forced alignment yeah i mean it is it is crazy we are in an anechoic room which we specially yeah built an anechoic but you know sound room which we specially built for this we are d in good circstances we should not screw it up more than we have to is there anything we can do to improve this yeah well no no better to collect and sort no no no do you have a powered microphone or something yeah not low the sol that right a mono microphone input that the line is stereo the input is mono right is that what you said right the sound the s well the yeah the the yeah the the the is ah stereo but when you plug in when any way yeah that is somewhere in the sound card and is not hard yep its own track its own video you have to align the videos anyway right the user on that one i yeah so well i am not the technical person who would do it but i know who to ask easy if if nothing if nothing else you h if nothing else you can do yeah yeah h read read h but it is the same as the the matlab the matlab script will h behind the other yeah well it is says robin thinking about cutting and splicing yeah yeah okay backup as well h h do not work then you do not get the overlap yeah i wanna see several of them i wanna see i wanna see one of them look really nice before we start running subjects can we do that have yeah be two guys talking yes that is right we have both been so badly bitten in the past yeah but this this i just wanna know it works the way you expect it to work this is not a a gesture of mistrust this is just experience that if anything can screw up it will i i am trying to choose my language carefully because we are being recorded but you will hear more choice language at the point when we have all done a lot of work and and then we discover we cannot use the session because of some thing we did not think about right yeah h yeah so then h h yeah h do do they both have the same right and then then we combine both got so yeah yeah it is probably worth mentioning this to the to the guys in the garage in toronto right to say h cause cause cause yes h h h the external h right guys i think that is a if the docentation said it w could record in stereo then i think we should talk to them about how they have done this is you are not sure from the docentation what it says it can do h and i have got a nice lunch right okay what okay about h yeah going to be right time and the right is okay and right i just right they were looking right okay so when you i mean given that there are these events recorded we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point for example right there are also motions being recorded of objects right yep so yeah so you h right h and looks but i okay needed or about these postanalyses you know the and right yeah yeah yeah i will but it is going to emerge over time i mean that is clear oh so the spec to the other conversation yeah so i am right that that that is great i i would before we break up for lunch i just wanna make sure that tha that i know how long it is going to be before we are in run mode okay so the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way we need to be recording sound online okay so that is a thing that has to be solved the shape thing is solved that is h we think we have to test well you do not have your models or do you we believe right so that is that that that should be done this week in fact like tomorrow for example the shape all the shape problems are solved generating shapes no problem scoring shape overlap no problem nothing is problem there there are no visual display problems yep h yeah they had their they had their inspection last week j_p_ staggered away from it and ah you know h okay s cause he that is what he said to us originally so i would asse i have not i have not had any discussions with him since yeah i do not think well he is ph he is physically here if we want to pay him for some more time we can do that would that be a just better use of our time in get yeah it does not matter right i think it is i think it is better to have all the but m he he he is around and i believe and if if the if i if it is a and yeah i if he can right but if if everybody has a lot to do and you know joe could give it a couple of hours which i is what it might take just to fix it then let us do it because starting runtime is now getting to be fairly urgent the problem h and we h bought him right yeah so it is a kinder way it yeah yeah but it sounds like right right but we cannot we cannot make joe do this ec alright so there is some tradeoff between availability and speed from start to finish given that this is somebody else is code so you know well yeah and you got work rats so and how many models right so we are we are b we are building models right we are we we have the design somewhere you got and h well h okay yeah i think so cause i have to check back with with j_p_ fairly soon okay he wanted to kn the eighteen the next eighteen month plan great deliverables great progress with the experiment well that is what we are doing now okay so what do we think if you have a fairly hectic week are we looking for subjects next week okay h that is her job come on ads go up yeah i do i do but i think ad should probably go up this week we want people for n for next week is that okay is anybody now terrified at the thought that we are live next week there are people coming in here one after another or p two two after two more likely yeah yeah okay is the is this is this generalised is this generalised anxiety robin or do you have a specific thing that okay so aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live so we w we wanna do some piloting at the end of the week yeah right yeah so okay i assu right s oh yeah okay right she is using but she is actually relaxed that somewhat yeah h h ostensibly booked time which is not you guys sort it out h right but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you are bped yeah okay we have but we have we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway right and l except by permission of us alright we own it so we can change that i mean they everybody acknowledged the the other week that we that we had priority oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah do not worry there is there is a booking system right so it is public what is booked and what is not that was the problem okay no cause you know i if you are sa told use the booking system alright maybe w should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see alright h yeah just a well we think we spoke to all the people who who used those facilities the other day but we could be wrong so h right cause you know we like people to know to ground the well the two key holders are here booking system oh i see see cause you are supposed from caroline or the general office the general office i see oh okay so that is the safety and you control those accounts oh okay that is fair enough okay h yeah that is safer cause then they learn the first time but no they need a they need an account on this machine to actually to use it they need account on these machines so that they could book they could not actually log in h okay we are also working on a way of making sure that the matin that the machines return to zero state when they are when you come off them because the it is the people have been leaving var well people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around on them right which which we think is what is critical so okay nothing right you got willing heads piloting piloting piloting you have we have to build the things we have to try the machi th things we have to check them with marloes and j_p_ that they like the representation the variables right how about you have any time on friday why i get a email back maybe you and i should be the pilot subjects first pilot subjects the ones who know which questions we wanna ask and then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing okay this is generalised floating anxiety no no it is it is it is wisdom but yeah well because actually we can i mean you know if we make coents they feed back in a lo into the development yeah the eye tracker does but five hundred hertz though first second after the parts h yeah okay so the percentage if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events h against bigger frames m m i i yeah but the p sort of start and end times will give you back to that output a as a and then you just measure it against you know the c the c yeah the culative total time record or something so right h span right right b m yeah so i will i will lag in some of it during the i suppose there is the the saccadic movement itself for example right yeah cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after yeah okay can we different demands th th th yeah the it should still come out that the little sketch i asked this p for for last week about n_x_t_ and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things that that should ra address all that h but but because it is also in the i based on the the time course of the procedure you will be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well is satisfying ellen is concerns well there is a whiteboard right right yeah yeah so i did have it somewhere i did not have it r have not brought it trying to remember it and is that they right h saccade the yeah so h is an extremely short event that is fine so it is in a region it is in a region okay but even so it m it m but br at that point they are all of it lped all the individual fixations as long as it does not move off that triangle together as a total sort of gaze gaze time on that yep yeah that that is a target within the target region so even so m other places h okay and m yes somewhere of that h so that yeah cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a d_v_ it it sh yeah it i mean as long as we are dif r yeah it there should not be anything missing and so that should be alright at one it will which will yeah yep know he might get m m yeah lap quite a bit right yeah yeah yeah so what h of interested in yes some meta level analysis should be right so we yeah so we if we have an an event yeah that that yeah the second line then for the second before it and then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it that is not a something that okay that should i i you could do right you know these yeah h yeah yeah oh yeah yeah so it is well it well if it is just based on like a a stable fixation for so long or or something and crossing into that region yeah yep right yep yeah yes because h yep h yeah yeah sure so h yeah y you need to be able to to h do not know not look at and that is h but that is a lot more more h yeah absolutely h yeah really interested in was the kind of coding well he is really interested in alright and and it was the negotiation h so which one does actually the interesting h right i will just i will just minute that right so wha right what well we but we have the now actions i mean actions might mostly be theirs right but since we have the the eye tracker i th we are going to have to answer h that is what i have understood it to be but well i do not know but w h h yeah eye tracker here gaze right yes h yeah right much less important are done with that and we will we have not looked at data like this with this with it is h alright i said that is the claim and so less how to get h that is right so this is not you know what craig programs for the initial you can we can announce now the green triangle h so you right so i am just you are happy our level of analysis s h well or it is a short you know you know this thing in itself but y y y th bunch of fixations right with saccades fixations and the percentage of h you mean to the tags of the data w within it yeah so so things like fixation the nber of fixations a and okay h bi yeah with some some measure of the so we could work out the nber of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well because having st long steady fixations can be informative h h h on it if if they are holding their if there is less dancing around the the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part so there is a difference between if they even though they are still looking at the same part if they are looking around it rather than just holding their gaze steady or and longer on it they were exploring the thing as opposed to they were simply alright there is it there it is yeah it yeah it is it is certainly it is it is worth h the screen no i would not want to throw out no no this is this is still put the actual location they are he is we are h one h possible as opposed to out of it so i mean presably it okay alright fine the so you just want to if well yes but that probably is not going to be easy to get out because you would then have to break up the parts somehow the fixation and would not that differ yep h it it yes it can do but it is also looking at it within their their own behaviour to see yeah yeah the spots will be different anyway cause i you are not going to g have the same pixel where the eye has fixed the nber of different fix oh ok okay so it is a jiggle rate okay right th w i i would say just the nber of fixations i mean it could just be yeah the nber of different yeah yeah h yep exactly so right as well if you want the smaller h h i mean to for yeah well i think yeah and in n_x_t_ there is yeah you can come back it yeah if if we have got everything then i suppose it is you can always yes it is you are not throwing anything away then or all we are right h did you want the you the nber of different ones but nber well the duration time as well somehow whether it is the average one or m not e well if it is in the region of the fixation well but you do not wanna d well what about the the overall s the the average should be alright to work with the the which way do you want to yeah then that is that is the way you want it that way around you have already got that well if you have got the nber of fixations in the average time you can then just generate it yeah yeah h which is sort can have as many of these as yeah again that that should be you should be able to derive that presably from you know that right the same region right okay right h it is yeah okay right s that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration but if we are building in a sort of error margin it it will be based on pixels around but there will also be a minim one cause i am trying to think that it is probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small it will need a slightly larger just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of b error margin around it right this definition is a is an object okay with some with plus or minus something or other yeah no the o the other person is gaze position as well h yep trea treated the same as as the mouse say yep h area yes yep which has a_ is gaze in the yes so if there if h you are yes h in the triangle region okay but not looking at their individual and pr fact they probably will avoid looking directly because if they are looking directly at it it is obscuring but the the part when these two h this yeah h h the okay if you h well well but y those by definition if the mouse is on the construct then right right h the m the mouse the gaze and the part are all layered yeah yep yeah yeah cause you get c right yes so what we h attention and there h h they are looking at be h oh right because if you have them close together there is always some fuzz factor around them and so if they are left lying if when they get moved together h it in the model h okay so h change that is the bad one h two objects close together your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other and they are sor therefore looking at two objects at once okay squeak squeak yes saying they need some new pens just say yeah pens whiteboard pens new pens whiteboard pens pens using h h unle but it unless we just define it as there is only they are they are exclusive and which ever area m has the greatest overlap is what they are actually looking at yeah that would ho ho well it w if if you have got your sort of eye position and it is it is unlikely to be exactly fifty percent in one object and fifty percent in the other my g my see i i am the one that uses the whiteboard cause i actually put the the microphones on this i think i think you are throwing information away well i put these things on yeah what i am i am thinking is if you have got say one object there and right you know so this is thank you part one and part two and you have got they are sort of they are looking there then that overlap means they are looking at the two pieces simultaneously but you had a but but it may be a bad idea it may be a bad idea you have just thrown data away yeah j yeah just if this is there is more of it yeah i yes that is w that is that is a decision we will i am saying is if they are looking if most of what their overlap is here then we stick with that one yeah well thing is that with they are looking at a pixel or something right right s right oh so those vary in size yeah yeah h yeah they could be the gaze will wobble the gaze will wobble that is natural h or indeed they might be looking from one to another d or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you do not want to decide that is th we no that because the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area it will not just be a pixel it will it will be an actual like circle and area yeah so i i it it that is that is going to be w it is it is not just a single point it is it is a it is a sort of lp target and so there will be a bit of a a sort some sort of overlap of two objects or b yeah they could just be oscillating h yeah that i was if they are really close to each other it is going to get foxed very likely that if people are considering f h well not if the regions overlap okay if the regions i h i mean if if they are oscillating though then that is presably going to st change the weight so you are actually going to see them flipping between when you decide they are looking there h if they are really close yeah neatly h defined region h yes just you know h we would better do a test the yeah h i_d_ starts and you get construct h well the i it is also going to be a problem because you are going to have one part or a construct forming in the middle of a fixation and it suddenly becomes right so you are you are looking at triangle one right and all of a sudden it ceases to exist so it is not going to be quite as clear if you cannot cannot chop it off h and then it yes and it becomes construct or assembly whatever two yeah right and then you can start again also when you when you screw it up you g start again no you can build sub subassemblies and then link the the part really yeah yeah i so each you c when you create a new yeah yeah there are there yeah wai w i th the the yeah the con the con the constructs says okay which constituent parts two parts made it made that that was the next construct in this definit should be you will be looking at the construct cause that is the way it is dis defined looking at areas within it well we will d yeah and decided h there might be multiple n n w i mean the we e okay they cannot replace the new parts only appear when the previous one is broken and if there is no more t_r_ one track the t_r_ one track is yes they ca they can appear without them you c then oh same shape and colour right okay are many same identity oh with same shape but not the same shape and colour same eye yeah yep oh okay so you can tell what it is meant the triangles red and squares green and oh okay well that is well that is that is what they are at the moment yes so that is the way it works at the moment i just asse that is how ni nijmegen had set it all up yep so so there so shape plus colour okay they are unique all th that is that is back to tim is day they are individual you have different colours for the yep unique yeah yep right yes the tam tamgrams are much easier when you can see the lines h yep it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle yep a thing we might do h yeah yeah so yeah two identical in the tamgram yeah we h h h yes it at the moment there are d there are two i think two small ones and two large triangles they are actually the same physical size and shape at the moment they are in different colours that also means in the p new parts list they are there for you know two v large triangles and two small one small ones say whereas in in the revised edition if they were all just black there would only be one mold in the new parts of the way we s as far as i know it is hardwired it just appears so well yeah yeah when you when you specify the molds okay so it is hardwired h the polygon one polygon two whatever it might be so so ho however many part however many mo however many parts there are in the file that is h so if you c that that yep so much like a single one zero variable change that h yep same same pieces the h the wood colour something the same part the same part is different colours oh no so they they can have different nuts there w well nuts that are different colours but same part in different colours yeah h no what i mean there is more than they are multiple pieces that look the same h green bolts h want h yes okay h you are taking together at things h oh yeah you said that yeah but you can but no no i mean you have to b and the extra parts do not appear so you cannot collect them yeah there there are a couple of them that it is like greyed out they really very faint so you see the mold is there but they do not come filled until you okay yes oh okay never mind then so they just have to use it yeah h yes i i it appears in the new p like suddenly the th th the new part lights up sort of thing and it is there yeah yes they have to bring it into play yeah where there is extra parts yeah okay so screw up you have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra h h h i but it does have replacement h h there there is no nope that yeah that that is one think unlike the say the baufix or anything we i asse the the baufix the there are not any extra parts and at the moment the software does not a allow for that yes replacement but no superfluous so you cannot have a a standard stock with extra parts that it will never use yeah because you appreciate h h you will yeah they do h by the by the yeah yeah you will h how would you do that bec yeah no you p they both put they intentional in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts but they c you know it is like the trash can idea that they bring a because but that is a han coding right h h yep so that just has to be coded h you have to hope that there is language and one of them says something you c h there is no there is there is no way you could tell that just from the the raw movements or or something yep j_p_ right okay but th let us do it like this yeah part it i make a wish list although what i am trying to remember is if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together they they do not both break they both they both if if if what if one not being touched h so the i intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks they intentional they could just screw up yep no they could just make a mistake or screw up yeah yeah yeah and then one guy does it yeah yeah or i do not think that is very good no we will never get y yeah but that is bringing in the the language thing again h let us just throw h h right was the percentage oh yes at the the percentage score yeah so our yes rather than the nber of penalties or or something no the the score w is fine part yeah yeah that is when i left oh yeah well do you know which which which which one was the top right yeah h but that is all been fixed that is that is that is back do not ye that is that is the way it is worked out but the problem was to do with the m the p they had a relative and absolute piece and it is all to s to the syetry of that so as long as it is defined fine yes it was not it was not a bug it it it was a yep no no it was them just dr forgetting to define an attribute they had to well whi which is probably a docentation fault right yeah yeah alright oh okay oh so h but the right not prominently flagged okay well yes it was something that had to be defined and the dutch lot did not so that was it was actually their their fault but it is not clear enough in the docentation yeah yeah but i it it is quite fundamental and causes quite iediate problems if you do not know about it yep exactly yeah yeah i mean i am i have th i have yeah it is it is in the docentation but it is like two thirds of the way down a quite a long page so yep is there there will not yeah h right so it does not slow oh i have to use a new page or oh we are well we yeah we should should go back to the beginning the camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because in the old version it seemed to interfere with it but when you when craig recompiled it and did his new version it started wor wor it seems to work fine yeah yeah we we p so we pay for nothing we can tell no no no the the the there is h it is not no yep yeah yeah yeah i know records they do not see their own gaze they see the o only the other guy is gaze right yes there will now have to be two camtasia records because e each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback they do not see their own gaze to the other person so there will need to be two separate camtasia videos generated h h hopefully we will not you mean officially or yeah but then the que the for camtasia if it is worth having so you are going to look into this right well y c look at the licence conditions it might not check out yeah i had not thought about the i was assing we would just get one and one licence both of us suppose technically we should have two because it will be two machines i suspect that it will it will be per machine i would think read em so well okay so we h i i will have a yeah i will have a l a look at the actual camtasia licence the other thing we are we because w it means we have got well no this is three times right h it cause it is now twice twice the size of a are we putting things is there is there such a h h h h you can dp em into one video well the other problem is camtasia has to be manually launched on both machines separately going to be a problem yeah during the task there is a flash and a bleep yeah before the task okay so that we would have to realign them we could not oh i mean not during the task before for each task yes yes two copies what what i th two videos are turning on there is no time camtasia y yeah but no so these are ba these are h right right okay no they are they are on two s the two separate machines and the you you start and end them separately the they they are not talking to each other they are just recording you start it recording and it starts recording what is on one screen and you start the other recording on the other machine and they are they are totally separate they do not know about the other one if you need to h h yep yes sometimes oh okay so you so right yeah and hand every time we recalibrated the damn thing slipped yeah that actually helps i mean yeah see how how long it took them actually that is that is true how long did it take them to calibrate or yeah how many t how many times before the validation worked or something yeah that is true i right okay yep h right no they that actually saves well it at the moment the that is what i was assing on on on doing that it is done first out when it will not because yeah that is a technical term that is a a technical categorization in psychological research h you go back and actually yes they were crap is not that the answer yeah yes the other thing we were getting sorted out was the the microphones cause only one of the camtasia videos will actually have the soundtrack well we need sound we we we are just getting we have got one cable and to the two mics i suppose we can do it is it would it be worth splitting it h that is stereo alright h on w on what sorry yeah so the at at at the moment it is ins well what we have finally just at twelve oclock today looks like we have got it sussed is to get one channel one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo single file unfortunately the on one machine on one of the con the display p_c_s yeah the camtasia v video that is not where you are putting on camtasia or m m multimedia thing our yeah yes through camtasia it it is yep it is camtasia that is recording it i the eye yeah yeah of just yeah yeah yeah but the ex yeah right right yeah that is yeah so so m so i asse that well once you have that sort of information you well you got the g_d_f_ format you then filter it to say right between time x_ and time y_ they are they are constructing that having triangle one to the construct and then you just say in that time period what percentage are they looking at triangle one what percentage are they looking at the construct does that sound does that sound reasonable they yep my kind yeah that so right actions eye tracker gaze h right as long right a and an end time so it is yeah all all the all events have a start time and an end time so but it seems it is yeah yeah yeah roughly yeah directly yeah h h h h h well it would the okay yeah cause i think that that is going to co that is cause b the diagram we got there suggesting that they are only looking thing at time so whether it is triangle or whatever else but so what you are suggesting there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer and maybe an eye at the same time okay okay well well but y those are different then right right and the part are all layered yeah yep yeah yeah cause you get c cause you want to know yep right yeah right yep yeah h right right h yep yep okay yeah so so yeah so so it is just a matter of adding these the two mouse pointers and the two gazes as extra objects so yeah as long as as long as they have got an i_d_ in there we can just say right at this p between these times they are looking at that object or they are looking at the mouse they are looking at whatever the case yep yeah so you are yeah can you write on my pen pad just say new pens pens pens cause they i confuse em unle but it yeah that would sort of good yeah thank you that is w yeah i am saying well thing is that with objects yeah you do not want to decide it is only one and throw the other one out h okay well that is fine h yeah thing thing is w_g_d_s_ formats is wor is working at the moment it is actually got a separate track for each part so that is yeah each one is yes or well the couple of dozen right well the the the it depen depends on the depends on what you build in there is different parts there is different parts whether you are doing the tamgram or whether you are doing an airpa airplane or whatever six to i know ways of getting around this analytically cause you c h yeah i mean but th but sa but thing is if if we if we got if we got tracks for each for each part we can we can easily analyse it down later on yeah it is not the data possible yeah well the it affects yeah and make things easier for people i mean so h yeah well the the the the does not really list part in the in the g_d_f_ so yeah that that that is not a problem there so that bas basically what i have got is well there there there is places where you got the i_d_ though so you have the an i_d_ for a part you got an i_d_ for a location on the screen so it shows you the target config the clock whatever else and then we can easy add i_d_s for the two mouse points and the two gazes and from that and ba basically all all the all the tracks are doing is saying at this between this time there is a look at this o this object yeah th this i_d_ so so it is effectively a track for each i_d_ do you still identify it as a part i mean i think one should lose the th yeah the but but i take it cause h h right so you h well wha wha what happen what happens there is that the the two the the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new i_d_ starts existing at the point where they are joined right yep yeah right and and there could be more than one yeah oh yeah yeah yeah oh and this definition i so each yeah that that that that is what that is what that is the way he is working the moment because it th it is it is generating a new i_d_ when you c when you create a new part the problem yeah yeah but there there is there is joint events so if the if a joint event if if if it is there is joint event linked to linked to the item then you know it is become part of a construct of yeah yeah there are there are yeah okay so we could we could essentially wai w i th which constituent parts yeah the the the yeah the con the con the constructs are already tagged with that so that i am act there is actually a s a separate file of the data format which says for each construct which which two parts made it made that came together to make that construct right but we will right so yeah but you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it so you can still find triangle one whatever the first yeah okay alright yeah but but that is easy n it is easy to do because the the co each construct has the i_d_s for the pa the things that construct it in this definit should be looking it is dis defined there is not a way to figure yeah yeah oh yeah h it is well okay because looking at areas within it well we will d yeah well with the yeah d well thing is that we we still have the x_ wa the x_ wave traces from the ascii formats so if if you want if you want to be able to say i am looking at a square instead of i am looking at the construct that is it is possible to get that data out it is it is yeah it is it is not doing it is not doing it in the gest analyzer at the moment but i can easily add it to give that information if you want yeah it is triangle two one h well how do i know what yeah if if you take it if you t if you crea if you create a new part it it gets a new i_d_ so if you get if you drag a new part out of the parts bin you do not because yeah there might be multiple triangles n n w yeah i mean the we e except that ex no you do not yeah i mean you know whi you know which way they match so you can there is no two parts yeah the yep so now let us a just yeah yeah yes it yeah so yeah yeah so i think that anything is loading there is there is then two triangle is not there there is two identical triangles in the tamgram right okay so it is hardwired so just appears so h the polygon one polygon two whatever it might be well yeah yeah when you when you specify the molds in the in the in the p the file that c that generates the parts like a list of parts the molds are bas just taken out of the the file that generate that specifies the parts so so ho however many part however many mo however many parts there are in the file that is how many parts appear in the in the parts box so minor modification needed for h h h h h h if you have five black triangles going to be five five parts in the fi five black black triangles in the parts box but what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can reuse a triangle so if you so if you only want one black triangle you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then reuse that pa that triangle five times in the configuration but yep yep okay it is well when the when the f when the final construct the the way the the way the the constructs are defined in the file you have got like your p your parent construct and the parts that it is constructed out of and yeah as i say the okay so yeah yeah so you got parent child relationship and i the child can be a part or it can be another construct yes okay okay right so we could zip we could zip through h yeah yeah cause there is a joint action the result the t what you need for a join action you need to yeah a construct and a part two parts whate whatever you are taking together and then the result of that is a construct you have got time when that happens you can see that construct appeared at that time and you can still track the children of that construct yep yeah they do it yeah h that is right right h yeah yeah well by by the by the time by the time they are doing that they must have already broken something so you will so you will know what they are replacing so they both they both they do if if if what if one if one person is trying to get a part to a part that is not that that so the part that is just sitting on the screen that is not being touched they both break they could make a mistake yeah yeah yeah and y yeah yeah right oh yes at the the percentage well yeah cause yeah c cause it was through the rotational part yeah it yep no well well whi which oh okay oh so so that was it was actually their yeah yeah i mean i am yeah h but the right not clear enough in the docentation yeah yeah but i it it is quite fundamental and causes i have th i have yeah it is it is in the docentation but it is like two thirds of the way down a quite a long page so yeah okay a counication flaw exactly yep but right so it does not yeah yeah we p so we pay for it and nothing we can tell no h no no the the the there is there is very small graphical bugs but it is it is not it is not big thing it is like couple of white pixels in the course of a in the course of a the course of a task so it is there is distracting alright no will not okay i mean yeah but then the que the que the question is there a licence for camtasia where you just need one editing c thing and two recording things cause yeah the r the recording yeah the recording thi pro program is just quite a it is quite a small program they just gen it just generates the video and so i do not know do not know if it is worth having a look at the licensing for that just to see okay so we i i will have yeah fine yep long it took them actually that is that is true alright finally putting it yeah no you got you okay so what you are planning on doing h yeah you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anythi anything else on the windows so you can you decide whatever quality you want so got a bit of yeah because the the synchronization the audio and vi the audio visual synchronisation comes at a specific point in the eye track file no it is yeah th it is i i sta stamped into it so it is just after just after it prints the line starting experiment yeah i will i am pretty sure it is just yeah but ho yep right so we can either adjust oh okay well the well the matlab script bas just sa just says yeah gi gi gives you the times of the audio beep in the s in the signal so i just to take yeah yeah got the bleeps oh yeah yeah pretty confident but you you have you have seen them it it was it was so we just yeah right right yeah i do not see him with ten he kilohertz yeah okay yeah yeah yeah ping you back and right okay so when yeah the the the there is a signal at the start and the end of every trial so pings back at you yep yep running things and so up i know but so you g you got a solution for that then oh right okay yeah yes it is a stereo jack it is a stereo jack but it is a mono but it is a mono microphone mono mono recording on microphones line in sp going going through a line in so it is a so it is a lit so it is quieter because it is not as though it is not powered but it is still think yeah we we still pick up a signal improve yeah well no no yeah well it is the mono wait wait w i i well the the when they are they are the the they have batteries in them but i there is not does not but does not seem to be powered because the because the line in input is so low i is expecting a mono microphone input that the line is stereo the so the sound the sound the s is that what you said right is ah well the yeah the the yeah the the the the jack that is that it is plugged into is stereo but when you plug in when it is recording from microphone it records in mono yeah i think a new sound card sounds and yeah a new sound card is fixable out yeah als think we we have a well i suppo i suppose it well one th one thing you do is re is record the sou speech signal separately for each for each person but then you would have to pull the two pull the two sounds together but it is only got one input right its own track its own video you have to align so if so if i i if each machine recorded its own with a recorded the recorded like the the p th the the user on that one i yeah i believe it is easy to put two monos into yeah oh they yeah and then the so the yeah so th yeah so yeah yeah so is there any well i am not the technical person who would do it but i know who to ask h h yeah it is easy easy if if nothing if nothing else you h if nothing else you can do it in a matlab script you just write read read file one read file two and then you just yeah but it is the same as h yeah but then the the the matlab the matlab script will tell you how l it will tell you how far apart they are cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them cause you got a l you got a list of where the where the beeps are and then you say right this stream is like i do not know nought point two five seconds behind the other one thinking about cutting and splicing yeah yeah is just yeah we have both bitten in the past i being recorded and then we discover h but this this yeah so then they have both got the same sound card so yeah yeah it is probably worth yeah yeah cause cause cause yes oh h h right yeah so the the external version is got plugs that size and that that is stereo microphones but yeah the other one is plug is like the smaller size and that is not stereo so the colour the colour can do it it is just that the connectors on the the connectors at the back of the computer cannot yeah but as as far far as we can and find the the web site of the yeah the the creative labs web site and the review of it and they were not entirely clear but they both suggested that it is there is a mono that there there is a mono microphone yeah it is yeah but i think yeah i am and then w yeah right right okay right right yeah so and basically out the output the g_d_f_ is just going to be a whole series of events you know with start and end time and the event is going to have whatever all whatever the object is that is being looked at and things and then yeah and then it is a matter of we are going to put whatever filters you need after that so you can say right i just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly find out how it is how m percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever yeah yeah yeah but i think the thing to right h right h okay yep so yeah so you got mo yeah there there is move events there is look events there is fixations and blinks now at the moment as well and yeah and oh yeah and see looks at looks at objects and looks whatever else so s try yep and then ellen will yep know the and yeah yeah yeah i will but it is i am that yep yep do not know have any change okay fair enough okay but we cannot like you do not think there is anything well yeah yeah that is her yeah yeah yeah right okay yep yeah so we will we will get we will get the get the audio stuff tested you know single microphones yeah get that tested next couple days and i assu i asse that is not something you need me for t in terms of that cause h which you all have to b you will have to be there to when it falls over yeah you do not you do not need me involved in the pilot do you so well unle unless unless it is a bug report yeah i will w yeah w i will i will i will b i will be around but yeah i will make sure but ho hopefully it will run smoothly and yeah i can relax so sounds f

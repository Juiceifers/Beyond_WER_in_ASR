yeah . we will find a way . and i have put yeah . well i was expecting to get , yeah , though and i did did make it in time . but it just just 'cause all the leaves and things . the stra the trains were not stopping at the stations . so they decided to put speed restrictions on really ? is it sliding yep . yeah . 'cause apar apar apparently p i am not sure . the and they are bussing people into station have particular problems on it 'cause it is on a 'cause it is on a hill or something . so i had so i had to bus people in from like stations either side . yes , yes . but yeah , at l at least it was speed restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things . so really ? great . i was th so what would they have to do , back up ? ah . nasty . yeah , yeah . go i we are glad ? yes oh , f yeah . . okay . yeah , disk check going to discover . 'cause everything is well , you know , apa pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get camtasia sorted out . oh . everything going smooth ? yeah , i have not i have not added anything to the wiki recently . so 'cause i have we have been been working on trying to get the x_m_l_ stuff working . so some the ba basically they only had to how the dom works , so i can do the next so i can ge generate d_d_f_ files . h ? so so th yeah , so just just been reading through docentation , that is what i was doing the end of last week just so i know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things . but i am at the moment i have i have been playing with the dom stuff in mozilla . 'cause i 'cause ju just so at least i can see how it works with the h_t_m_l_ pages so i can generate the x_ so i can generate x_h_t_m_l_ stuff and see how it all works there . just 'cause to just see how things work in that and oh yeah . -h . -h . the oh , well it well , thing is that the a_ the a_ well the a_p_i_ is standardized by the w_ three c_ . so the a_p_i_ is stan is standard between everything . idea . so yeah , yeah . well y or that i do not wanna name who do not always get yeah , yeah , yeah . it is . it it just has a couple of yeah , yeah . well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that . so i was doing the is anyway . it is ju it is just that that is that is quite a quick way to just to get into how how works . because i can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah , add things to and take things away and do not see exactly what is going on at the time . so . so okay . i believe you now , it is a good strategy . -h . oh well just 'cause x_h_t_m_l_ has a nice you know , you got browsers there , so you can actually see you can actually see directly what is what is going on . yeah , but most m most yeah , well i will i am using x_h_t_m_l_ to deter that is all all the web pages are x_h_t_m_l_ . so it is x_m_l_ just with the h_t_m_l_ d_t_d_ . yeah . ju ju ju just ba just 'cause we have not we have not f have not quite finalised the the g_d_f_ format . so just just well just . okay , so all you are going to have to yeah , yeah . so all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it is yeah . yeah . . okay . ev everybody is got their different ways of doing these things . i am yeah , yeah . . no , i am just try yeah . yeah , but , but yeah , that sounds that what what what what i am doing the moment i am looking through the s the stuff that robin put on the wiki to say what is , you know , what what we need in the in the t in the output format for the for the task , you know . so what what you are what you are going to do the analysis on . so i am making sure that i can take get that information out of the g_d_f_ as it st state of the moment . and if i find something that you cannot get out of it then i can add that to the add that to the g_d_f_ format . so -h . yeah . as a yeah , yeah . ? and it was not yeah , well the view at this point . so y are you working well i am i am i am ju try i am making sure that the g_d_f_ format we have got at the moment will d will output say well i have output old analysis that that robin is looking for . so so i am using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the dom things as well . so yeah . so at the moment i am looking at act actually the g_d_f_ format itself and then to generate the g_d_f_ format i am going to be taking stuff out of the gest analyser and then using a dom parser to generate x_m_l_ output from the gest analyser . so the data format translation . oh okay . so you have not looked at what is no . no . but i will when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already , which is what i will m plan to use that as the basis for it . 'cause that already that already picks up like target regions , things like that . so you get so so it knows whether you are looking at a part or whether you are looking at target area or what or whatever . so yes , as long as it got that in it somewhere . so it is just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the into the g_d_f_ stuff . . not yet , oh okay . yeah . -h . okay . so yep . , right yeah , bu . and i am not sure what else yeah , yeah . i i think the o the only thing i have got left to do before the experiments can be run is get s is get the check camtasia works . now i have got camtasia running on machines and i think they are set up correctly . but i cannot test it until we get the microphones working . microphones . until you get the -h . 'cause . it is ah . well he must some these days anyway , is not it . so so oh yeah . of course yeah . so we all got off easy . , so it is even yeah . ah well ca i can easy i can easy get to mapl to maplin i know where it is off i used to live there . so i know i know where i used to live here . i am a geek . i know where i know where maplin is . know your way around . ah yeah . oh yeah , c yeah . yeah . i just think well i i yeah . yeah no well i suppose i could gi i could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi it is not been in your in your f pigeon hole , i can easy go off the train and early and just pick 'em up from there . right , yeah . well i will make sure i make a i will make sure of i got the f the phone nber in my phone so i can call them . all true . true . it is dalry road , is not it . anything out of it . so was not ellen yep . i t i would say you do not be . how r f how recently that . yeah , yeah . screen shots . yeah , yeah . builder to the actual yeah . oh . , so h . eighth well i am i am using dice machines . if he wants to pop in for five minutes , the the windows machine is free for him at the moment . well , he is just not yeah . after it was yeah i mean i considering we get an email from the i think it got sent through saying that he would updated the the whatever it was on the wiki . so you do he would he would uploaded a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one . so yeah -h . yep . yep . yeah . , most the time yeah . these yeah . well when the whole thing was if it was going to run a trial that will give you some some screen shots to work with . and then it will just be a matter of adding new video f mouse movements or whatever . so . . h . . have a look . if you th anything prob any problems with it think there is a wiki page up for that f for that piece of for yeah , for that thing . so if if you just put just put whatever recoendations , bugs on that page and i will work through them read 'em as and when i can . . -h . . have a look at yeah . marloes yeah , yeah . . . yeah . and like these yeah , i mean i have used the software and there is not that hard i mean . it it should not yeah . . well you of and all this if quite quite right yeah . so well i cannot imagine the building the building the mold is going to be that hard . i mean i can easily just well however many thousands are on that dutch web site you found . just , you know , pick pick some of them , redo them in in the ja in the j_c_d_ format . that is yeah . it is pretty mechanical . i can easily d easily do that . so but it is a matter of choosing which ones you need to do . which i guess you have to do . well yeah . yeah well you need to you you and marloes need to sort out , yeah . yeah . well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah . yeah to recover . yes i do not think do not think so . i mean so the the major thing i have gotta d got to do is get this camtasia sorted out . so just waiting for the batteries for that . if robin is not worried i am not worried . . . you are going to run -h . p . the g_d_f_ yeah , yeah , 'cause i will go gotta finalise that format and then once that is done , i have gotta start looking at the analysis side of it . and that is -h . well so it was the whole yeah . yeah , but yeah , yeah . i think yeah . no , the the analysis i think the analysis will take a little while . i do not think it is going to take that long to get its stuff sorted out . it is going to be how to display it and all that sort of stuff . whatever makes it easiest for you to do . but once w yeah . it is just what i am worrying it w worried -h . h . oh yeah start yeah , yeah . yeah , so i still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a g_d_f_ outputter . and oh yeah , and i will i can have a look at the model builder as well . 'cause one thing i am thinking about is w we are looking at the the part building pa type stuff . and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the model builder . just just the ju i just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway , the j_c_t_ parts from from s_v_g_s . yeah . so we will worry about it then . -h , yeah . yeah . what i do do not know is we wanna bother with a part builder . i mean the idea yeah . yeah , yeah . but i will wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it . 'cause if if i can use it to generate the rotsym angle for example and the rotation syetry stuff for it , which is what was causing the bugs before . so if i if i can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it will d save a few bugs . so , right ? yeah yeah yeah . or do y m yeah , but now now -h . -h . no . it is it is just something you gotta remember once the part is been built . so , so yeah -h . yeah , yeah . well i am not not not pl not planning do much on that . it is just , right ? so how how many -h . yeah . i mean i have i have already i have already got this yeah . . yeah 'cause it really is not worth it . you you yeah , other i saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list . you will have to learn about . so it is it is not like you are out of work . right . . right . yeah , well that that is that is just x_m_l_ to x_m_l_ to x_m_l_ , is not it . turning g_d_f_ and what other bits into n_x_t_ . . so oh , yeah yeah yeah . but you know , there is -h . w yeah , yeah . . it takes stand-off right , right . yeah 'cause that is the yeah , o other than you have from what i have heard about it is both x_m_l_ . so the the prograing side of it does not sound too hard . it is going to be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format . so but no that is that is fine , i will d i will have try to find i will i will have plen plenty of plenty of questions for you once i once i get to the last stage , i am sure . . and , you know , there is stuff to learn there . so yeah , yeah . yep . so yeah yeah . yeah . . we will find yeah , we will yeah . well the we are going to get camtasia sorted out this week and then it is concentrate on the on the gest analyzer , the g_d_f_ stuff . and then yeah , once once we have done that it is whatever whatever you whate whatever you whatever you want me do once i done the once i have done the g_d_f_ , i guess . okay twiddling your thbs , no . yep . yeah , so i think the g_d_f_ will keep me busy for a little while yet . so yeah , well that is yeah , certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage , i guess . yeah yep . okay . -h yeah . for the first , yeah . yeah . ? so it will be h . actually yeah , that reminds me , i wo wo i wo i will not be on thursday i am going to be over in my induction day . so so oh you have got your induction , that is right . fair enough , fair enough . i mean i do not it is meant to be that in depth . it is yeah yes . from a total waste of time to , you know yes , yes . i mean i d i do not expect to be that in depth . i mean it is fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics . so it is just it is it is . yes it is . i am sure most of it i already know . it is like fire safety . yeah . health , safety , data protection . usual sort of stuff you get everywhere . so . yeah . yeah -h . it is probably yeah . yeah . well , if they were yeah . . i am pretty sure , is it . yeah , i mean i can remo i got invited to a for new staff members . but that was but yeah , i can remember when i start being a st when i was sta starting being a student . i mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching . and you could not do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah . 'cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room . so oh yeah . h . so but yeah , i am not sure i am not sure why the why why i am doing it now . but okay . . so see how it go . i will i will give you my report on friday or something . yep . - . yeah . seems fine h . okay . . know so so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then . it right . so tha tha that is that is for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker , is not the analyzer software that comes the eye tracker . the default yes . yeah as a separate right . are right , okay . well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation , it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the g_d_f_ stuff . so to remind me so to to just add that analysis to , yeah , to to it . so it is i mean it is easy enough to do , just che just checking the times th times of the events . yeah . a detection . but . -h . i y yeah . i mean it it it will not right . okay , okay . yeah . but what we yeah . yeah 'cause i think the ascii format as it stands does contain blink information 'cause d d i am sure i am sure that is appeared in the in the docentation i have read through . yes . -h . yep possibly . possibly , yeah . , you know , it it treats it as a right . okay , okay . yeah , so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ascii format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis . 'cause i have gotta do the analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway . so yeah , i d i i i did not think check for blinks during that . is not going to be a should not be a big problem . yep . it yeah . yep . so we will be if they are not . right , -h . and so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time you are looking at this object . between this time this time you are not looking anything . and yep , yep . yeah , yeah . 'cause i think i think at the moment the g_d_f_ format has fixations in it . so so i gue i guess that would be part of the g_d_f_ to transformation would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else . okay , okay . well tha tha do not do not worry about that just the moment . but well , it is not okay . -h . yep . to ye yeah , -h . viewing times . right . right . so so so w will you actually be doing much of the g_d_f_ ? or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the n_x_t_ stuff then ? so whe when you when you actually generate your results . -h . right . yeah . yeah . c well yeah , you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the g_d_f_ stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff . so you can get some some results anyway , cannot you . okay . yeah . yeah . i mean it to some extent it -h . -h . right . okay , okay . 'cause you you h . c right . oh yeah yeah . the germans do not yeah , yeah , yeah . sort of compresses it and things . yeah , the german stuff fair enough , fair en . you can put yeah , so so they they we are allowed to do whatever without without source code . there is no c sort of restrictions on that . fair enough , fair enough . so . -h . yeah , i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up some docentation on it . that will gi that will give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things . yeah , easy . c yeah , create all the switches and whatever else you need to do . so . -h . h . -h . okay . okay . yeah . so we will on once yeah . well once i have had once i have had a bit of bit more look at this g_d_f_ stuff , then start looking through that . start looking through that and make sure that works . 'cause -h . 'cause al also yeah . can stri it yeah , yeah . i have l yeah i have no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well . so but as ah . well b but we do not wanna as well . so it cleans it up . -h . -h . yeah . well i use it that useful for generating this g_d_f_ stuff , i can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when i am do doing the g_d_f_ stuff . so yeah . i am just thinking . yeah , yeah . i mean but what , yeah , say what what i will what i will plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software , find out what functions are useful for us in that , and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the x_m_l_ file , the the g_f_ format . yeah . yeah , i can imagine -h . yeah , yeah . so so the fir fir first part that will be docenting what they have got and then discussing it with robin . so yeah . so so i suppose pose that that way the . -h . well , sounds good . -h . it is it is not quite s it so it is right . but yeah , well i tr mo mostly , yeah . i am sure i sure most the logic is going to be going to be the same . so yeah . yeah , well yes , -h , the actual right . yeah , fair enough . the idea is you yeah , fair enough . well so so it is so long as it is x_m_l_ , n_x_t_ will handle it , will not it . 'cause -h . yeah . lossiness . yep . fair enough . but still not quite sure okay , okay . . so 'cause you were going to get overload no yeah . well i am well i am well g i have got the hang of all the stuff i have been going through . and it looks like l looks like i am coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already . so i am going to have start looking at that as the next stage . so yeah . so yeah . he is a cool customer . he is ready for it yep . . well really need . find well , i ma i ma i may be maybe i want to check out these batteries and things , will not i ? so tomorrow . well , that will be something to do . well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today . so . this one is mine . it oh yeah , well that will take forever . that is that is really fun . check your batteries . i guess not . yeah . yeah i mean if you are ever , you know , late 'cause of that , it is not we will find a way around it . and i have put you guys on mondays at this time for my convenience , but it is not like it is important that yeah , it says to put speed restrictions really ? yep . yeah . 'cause apar apar apparently p i really ? great . i was th so what would they have to do , back up ? ? problems on so i had so i had to bus ah . nasty . yeah , yeah . go i we are glad they will look after that bit . yes . i do not know . do we wanna look at anything ? it is not up yet . still fifty i can oh i do not know what it is doing . oops , that fell off . does not like silk . stay . and now we are going to discover we have got no reason to meet , right . 'cause everything is going swiingly . yep . well , you know , apa pa apart from apart all oh . yeah , i 'cause i have not been i have not read the wikis in my email since i left . so . h ? so oh yeah . -h . . -h . and it well , thing is that the oh , well i do not know the mozilla stuff . so if it turns out that it is idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits , then it will not have been a good idea . so everything . or yeah , yeah , yeah . it is . it it just has a couple of yeah , yeah . well y th there are certain companies that i do not wanna name who do not always get it right . i c but m yeah , mozilla . yeah , it will be alright . so okay . i believe you now , it is a good strategy . it is ju it is -h . wh why does it help that it is x_t_ h_t_m_l_ instead of just x_m_l_ ? directly what is what is going on . yeah , but most m most browsers , when when you put an x_m_l_ file up in it , it will just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you yeah . ju ju okay , yeah . just well just yeah , yeah . so all have to okay , so all you are going to have to do is swap in tag names later . okay . yeah . yeah . ev everybody is got their different ways of doing these things . i am sure that is fine . like having to g it is h . . as long as it comes yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah , but yeah . no , i am just try i am trying to l think of the things that could go wrong . but since i have not tried it this particular way , you know , but yeah , that sounds good . so i so you say we have not finalised what the g_d_f_ looks like . is that an implicit request for me to do something ? or . if i find something -h . . so yeah , yeah . yeah . as a well , i mean there is two two cases in here , right . there is things you can get straight off the original format , and then there is things you have to do some kind of post-processing of the original format . but it is not just a data format change , it is actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well , right ? and it was not y i think it was a little bit confused last time we spoke about whether yeah , well the well i am i am i am ju try u whether you consider g_d_f_ format to be the thing that is just the straight-forward translations of what is in the original eye-tracking output , or whether like whether the post-processing utilities are a separate step . 'cause i think you and i had separate different views on this , but i cannot remember w who had which view at this point . so y are you working actively on this anal these analysis things or you just working on the translation ? so the data format translation . x_m_l_ output from the gest analyser . no . no . but i will when oh okay . so you have not looked at what is in there and what is not in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do . not yet , oh okay . that already that already yeah . . -h . stuff . yep . yeah , bu okay . so this sounds like it is under control and you are happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know . so i do not need to do anything , right . you are all fine . but there was a nber of things that came before this , right , that it sounds like they are not under control yet . so so you know , the g_d_f_ stuff with so i ellen is view on this is we go through everything in order . like the priority is exactly the pipe-line order , right ? so camtasia you mentioned . and i am not sure what else , but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do . nope , do not think so . . microphones . 'cause until you get the oh , microphones . batteries . . the they are they are due okay , are they really really strange batteries ? have you tried maplin ? are they expensive ? possibly 'cause you know , like a wee bus journey over to maplin might solve the problem if it is getting in the way . . so this is not actually ruining your schedule for anything , and that is why you are waiting . right , okay . it is i so it sounds like you are not actually worried about the fact that this is the m yeah . when you get worried , go to maplin , okay . phone them first to make sure that they are in there . somebody around must have a probably steve . somebody in the techie group will have a maplin catalogue . fact , i will see if i can yeah , it is useful to know who is got a current one anyway . i do not seem to get them anymore . i guess i do not buy enough equipment . to check . not yet , no . right . right-o . so oh yeah . of course . d . so you can find out whether they have it . but you would have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there . i actually live not that far from there . so virtual . yep . yeah . so we all got off easy . yeah it would be a half hour diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff . w but then again , it is also very close to haymarket , so it is even less of a diversion for you , probably . except you do not know your way around . right . but what we are used to live there . so i know i know where ah yeah . oh yeah , c yeah . . yeah . i just think well , you know , for the sake of three quid or however many quid it how many batteries does this thing take ? does not take a hundred . -h . it no yeah , then , you know , put your mind at rest . yeah . 'cause , you know , you would not want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording and then suddenly discover yeah . you know this . no no . no . yes check they got 'em first though . their stocks are a bit funny down there . enough if you want . -h . all true . true 'cause you know , it is not that attractive an area to walk through if you are not going to get anything out of it . so of all the things that were on the wiki do i need to pull up the wiki ? ah , it is going to let me log in . no , i do not wanna change my password . . but you guys probably know off the top of your head , is there anything else that we we we were waiting on before you could run ? cannot remember so all those tasks craig had when it started . the only thing that well the thing that is holding his last day was the thirty first of october . the the ninth yeah , no no . it is ours . yeah , it is ours . oh , so he is got ours left.he is behind-hand . but no , he was billing for he was billing by the hour . so i thought well , i mean obviously if he wants to finish off then you know . i b certainly he right . i think he is had something like seven . but n oh well they are probably away then . was not ellen away ? they are really at the same place . it w e e ellen is away . n no oh , yeah it could be it . a and oh , you have no models at all . oh , that is a pity . model buil builder , that is what i was calling the graphical model editor , right ? so you use x_ fig to make the parts and then you this thing . yes , -h . well no . well we do not need to oh okay . . the x_ fig thing is yep . yep . okay . i have something in my email about from joe . he would not have sent it just to me , would he ? do you want me to check that ? i am not going to project my email . yeah , if you got right okay , i think i mighta heard thursday or something . i cannot remember exactly when it was . yeah . that is oh . h . okay , so i have got something on the twenty eighth . that is friday i think . oh , he just wants to know how to get paid . right . that suggests he is done done done . anyway , he is in edinburgh . so well i suppose he will not come by 'cause craig is on his desk . yep . yeah . so is he ? oh no , right okay free for him at the moment . well , he is just not going to try to le squat there , that is all . well i so the last thing i have got from him about work work was the nineteenth of october that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted . that is oh , so you did not get that . it was me and him . but presably the he put it on the wiki . so so he is just telling us 'cause he things we probably do not read wikis . and i will just check . the old one . so yeah . well i i have not replied to him about yeah , i really do not have anything more more recent from him . s i have not replied to him about yep . you know , how to submit costs and stuff like that . so but that suggests he is at at the end of things , but w we could just ask him . i mean maybe you guys would just wanna ask him directly you are done done , right ? 'cause it is worth you guys knowing . and then of course any problems that remain you inherit . right , you know , it is worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want , i guess . so th the problem is you want you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from marloes . . yes . yes ah yeah , yeah . things and to right , have you you tried cold-calling her ? that is what i do when i need things that yeah . ach , try phone . request when i if you get 'em today , when are you going to start running ? oh right . so you have to be you have to be ready by then . . next week . yeah , or re change the schedule . i have not booked anybody in or anything right , okay . . we -h , yeah . makes sense . yep . subjects , you are going to have d but we are we are needing yeah . so s y y you do not have subjects lined up , but you do not expect any trouble getting them . no . -h . . yeah . by ? i do not know this person . so they well , they need to be serious about it . who who is their is that a staff member or a student ? okay . well , we kinda paid for the lab . so it depends , but i suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems . you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it ? is it a have di yep . right . i mean presably he or she is not running subjects the entire block book for how long ? quite solidly booked -h . from -h . so ellen is still out of town , right ? it is just y you could try calling this person and see how this works . ellen might be more persuasive . it is just sometimes academic staff have a bit of a chip about research staff . and since i do not know the person , i cannot tell whether it is one of those or not . i -h . yeah , and then escalate , i guess . but , you know , or whether they can be put off for a little bit or something . so i have no idea how the booking system works . well , you are discussing it on thursday , right ? at the moment , there is just a booking system . yeah . i i well yeah , at the m yep yep . well that is that is one to raise at the meeting . i v might talk to ellen about that ahead of time 'cause they may have she and martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab . -h . i th in oh really ? yeah , but i g do not you guys set up for is not block-booking more appropriate ? because i i is not there set-up involved in changing around for somebody else ? no ? or in the software or anything ? okay . anything . no . so there is no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons . yeah . s so in the worst case you may be able to make an argent if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week . is this something that is known outside ellen is head ? . it is just the it is on the w booking system . it is on the p oh well . that is something . . which i do not know if yeah . -h . well , most the time to to p yeah . so it sounds like you have got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need . of course try to be kind to other people . but you would anyway . so . -h . yep . so those are the only things that are worrying you , camtasia and lab access . and otherwise no sweat , you are happy . oh and the model builders , yeah . we well oh yeah . h -h . . . these this is going to take a little while . yeah -h . yeah , but you were going to try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that or no , you were just g really going to run a video of the sep of the trial . yeah , okay . that is that is much easier . u yep , yeah . so with the model-builder , what do you need to do with it ? th the which one you is going to look at what it does so far and you will just t try out do that . yeah . i will i will do that . yeah , and just yeah yeah . hopefully yeah , yeah . -h . how many models were you relying on her for ? so are you suddenly going to be . i have i been divided well , what i am trying to get at is is your start time going to be delayed 'cause you do not have the models ready if she does not come through ? way . but yeah . -h . yeah . well -h . un can you draft craig in to build some if necessary ? yeah . if yeah . well you know me contingency planning and all this . i always worry about the worst . or or of whatever . yeah . yeah . no quite quite right . yeah . so yeah you can call a jast telcon between you and marloes . you know , i if it is not that see , you know , with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether they are alive and get an an offer to to get something . but , you know , the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this . we are going to talk about it , you know , tuesday , at such such a time unless you . yes . book a time but presably whatever it is they have been going through is now over . and see what i think -h . yeah . i d today they are now free again . or taking a week i would just hate for that to c to slow you up in collecting stuff , that is all . . obvious yeah , okay , that is true . well that sounds . that is that is the pro so it will be generated . it is that is quite a small thing she can do for you , i guess . you know . it is not like , you know , w sitting there brain deadly constructing , you know , some models that she needs to do . it is just to provide advice about this , which must take take less time . or not that i think that is right . -h . yep . well , that all sounds fine . you guys worried about it ? you worried about anything ? we have mostly been talking about the experiment schedule . so . . . p you are going to run out of things to f do that we have not set you up for any time soon . the g_d_f_ sounds like it might take a wee while . . yeah , but you do not need anything from me for that , 'cause that is already sorta speced . i mean again that is the pair of you . for you to do . but once w yeah . it is just what i am worrying it w worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis on or something . 'cause you are going to be completely unavailable when you are recording ? or will there be times when you do not record all day . -h . get h . yeah . 'cause he might oh yeah , no no no , i understand that . it was it was more like oh , it was more like , you know , you so this week he is got , you know , the g_d_f_ stuff to do . then next week you are planning on recording . and what happens if suddenly you are unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of work ? . i cannot just go in , let them get start and then come back . it is so some people can , but th they will certainly yeah , yeah . yeah . so so we will worry about it then . my email and things anyway , so yeah . and -h , yeah . 'cause yeah . from s_v_g_s . yeah . yeah what i do do not know is we wanna bother with a part builder . i mean the idea was it was not worth the investment , right ? for it , which is what was causing the bugs before . so if i if i can use the model yeah yeah yeah . or do y -h . it will d save a few bugs . so no . it is it is just something m yeah , but now now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the rotsym some stuff , do they have do you have trouble doing it ? no , so no . yeah , yeah . well i am not not not pl not planning do much on that . it is just yeah . well g i mean we might want to severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder , right ? so how how many person days would it be worth , like if craig discovered it could be done in x_ days -h . yeah . i mean i have i have already i have already got this yeah . yeah , other i saw saw saw saw something about right , so there is your limit . do not spend more than a day or two on it . yeah 'cause it really is not worth it . you you have to understand there is things about this project we have hidden from you so far that you will have to learn about . so it is it is not like you are out of work . . right . right . yeah , well oh really ? oh , that one will just be a little add-on . that will whatever it is , it will be the same skills as you have learned for something else . and it will just be i am not even sure that is you 'cause i think somebody else is doing that actually . but i am thinking more of the fact that at some point we should probably tell you about this n_x_t_ stuff . so -h and what other bits into n_x_t_ . yeah , yeah . right , right . yeah 'cause that is the yeah oh , yeah yeah yeah . but you know , there is x_m_l_ and x_m_l_ and , you know . it takes stand-off links and stuff and it is some some people if they are not used to linguistic annotation c it c take a little time to get their head around the way the do data data model works . and , you know , there is stuff to learn there . so expect out of the format . so yeah , yeah . yep . that is that is fine so yeah . yeah . yeah , we will yeah . so just do not witter away , you know , weeks on fripperies when we have got the real me meat of this yet to come . we will find we will find plenty of really really crucial s things for you to do . so -h . i , i guess . okay . so i will remind myself to look at what is next before the next time we get together . guess . yeah . so you collect on monday ? that means you do not wanna meet , right ? oh , r right , it is actually next week . it is actually the week that you were planning on . it it starts oh okay . well , i do not know . anyway you will tell me whether it we cancel this . or whether i just talk to craig . in which case we will not be up here 'cause we do not record twos . -h . oh yeah . that should be fun . let us see , that is like the . for i have got two weeks of that , fo that comes at an ideal time for you then . that is like the twentieth or something . . i cannot add . monday is the what is tomorrow , is the yeah . for oh yeah , you have to promise to tell us how that is . 'cause people do ask me . yes , yes yeah , on a scale of one to seven . know . it is yeah . yeah , you would be surpri these things do probably the university will cover itself yeah . yeah . yeah . well , if they were going to do that then they would force you to go to it . i would and i would know somebody who would gone to know . you know . i am pretty sure they did not have induction in my day . so . no i suppose rather than being nobody is bothered so far , is it . really ? but you only started here they were supposed to , i am sure . oh well . . 'cause you were the responsible oh yeah . yep . . . so see how it go . i will . -h . okay . which hopefully yeah . . does seems reasonable . layers like that so it will be like in monitor . but yeah , they will all be different tiers like that . and then there is the language stuff as well presably . yeah . yep . yes , -h . m that is yeah , this is the easy stuff . yeah . well , eyes and mouse . eyes and mice . other sort of stuff , yeah . -h . and that is enough for you , right ? i mean that is just the way you want it . course there are lot lots of things that can do that . but it is the language part that is the hard part . yeah . it ho hopefu hopefully that is yeah , i guess it is that is why i dre as well . yeah , -h . yeah yeah , that is the the new yeah . that seems fine , yeah . do you know what the the sets of codes are ? well the whatev whatever whatever you are getting out of the jast analyser . so i mean blinks as well , right ? oh so you do not want a pa part of this data ? tra aye . but . i suppose it could go in i think you i think you should well , there is two views on this . if you do then the people formulating research questions will ask about them . but if you do not they will probably ask about them anyway and then you will have to add 'em after the fact . so it is probably easier just to s shove 'em in . you can stick 'em in a different track and and then load 'em or not load 'em as you please . 'cause it is not well , i do not know . with is it is it part of so th these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time , right ? is not blink a part of this ? we are as well to have it if we can . right . well just say stick 'em in anyway . yeah . -h . -h yeah . but but is not that important ? because when they are blinking , basically it is like an a nil code . you c cannot find out what they are doing otherwise . so it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you are doing . so it could be that if they only they had not had a blink just then , they would have been i do not know what . -h . the way they are looking , -h . -h . i am thinking more blinking at the same time that you wanna know about . oh , i hope n not to much relies on missing stuff 'cause people blink . i was thinking more like , you know , the person looks a p a part and they have got a fixation before and after and there is blink in the middle . and , you know , there may be times when you wanna treat that as one thing , right . -h . yeah . yes . norman oh right . okay . so but in that case 'cause right , -h . in that case then these tiers are already like blink corrected . and then you would not have blinks as part of this . you would want blinks as a separate tier if you are going to have it in . yes , so that they will include the so i i yeah , would ha it yeah . yeah , so the key thing is he here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive . and the second key thing is it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes w yeah , whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that . 'cause , you know , it would not necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes that the actual position . -h . what is included and what is n yeah . -h . h h . yeah , i suppose if you know about eye trackers then you will just know . but -h it i think you are just saying it comes out of the eye tracker already , right ? they are already blink-corrected . i there enough to do , just yeah . . okay , okay . yeah . but what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye tracking stuff where it does that and whether that gets through so that craig gets it automatically in what he is translating or to g_d_f_ . whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker . or whether we even like it , right , and wanna do it some different way . -h . yep . -h . h . some other way possibly . possibly , yeah . yeah . but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus there is blink information . so , you know , it it treats it as a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are . 'cause as they were saying , they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something . so sort of event . -h . we will be if they are not still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink , then why is that is that the right thing to do analytically ? oh right . yeah , you said that . . well , but does the duration of fixations count for anything ? 'cause it if you are just adding the length of the blink to the fixation , you are not treating it as a saccade . okay . duration wait . . it is only okay . i kinda get this . yeah , yeah . -h . . is it it is a a sort of composite viewing so more complicated than i thought . i would forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object . yeah . okay . yeah , i am afraid -h . do not worry about that just the moment . but well , it is not okay , i mean this is kinda what we were talking about before , this confusion about what is in the g_d_f_ . i mean you might see it as the initial g_d_f_ is just whatever straight-forwardly translates without , you know , without transforms , with just the data format changing from the ascii . and then there is a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in augmented g_d_f_ format , you know , like this blink and the gaze and whatever else . and then you translate to n_x_t_ . so you might still wanna have everything in this one g_d_f_ file format that represents everything . and then the n_x_t_ thing is just a splitter . it is not doing any fancy analysis . so i see this as , you know , a bunch of little routines that take the the g_d_f_ without this information in it and add new information into th sub-script versions of the g_d_f_ file that contains these post-process analyses . . -h . right , yeah . -h yeah . yeah . stuff with . okay . yeah . right yeah . i mean it to some extent it does not matter which data format it is in , n_x_t_ or g_d_f_ . but it makes more sense for the converter between g_d_f_ and n_x_t_ not to add any data . all it does is do this this stupid data format conversion . and it it is just , you know , separating it out in the little steps . so , you know , there have to be these other scripts that add any data transforms not data format transform forms , but data transforms . like this idea of of putting together gazes from fixations . so y you know , i if we keep it simpler like that so that it is in little pieces , then it will be just easier to understand w what the wh the whole thing does . . -h . h . . okay , okay . right . 'cause you you c you know , i if suddenly you discover there is a problem with the g_d_f_ to n_x_t_ transform , you wanna know whether it is one of these little post-processes going wrong or whether it is just the thing that dps it into the multiple files for the and g_d_f_ to n_x_t_ transform is c is pretty simple . so , you know h . c an and oh yeah . them in or or enough . so that is like all the analysis that you need to do to things . are you just going to copy what they do ? or is it docented like why they did it they way they did it ? or is it just . well it is good starting point , right . so it would be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do things . of things . yeah , so i g i yeah . that is that is why . so -h . . yeah , yeah ah . well but as well b but we do not wanna build it into our data path . we just wanna learn from it , i think , right ? correct ? or no ? right . b fine stuff . so yeah . i am just thinking , you know , like i so this takes the ascii to to a d simplified ascii . and simplified in with transforms in it ascii and it is just it seems to be harder to maintain something that is got that in it if it would be better to break things up into like steps . that you know , as part of the the and als well why do i think this ? i do not know , because it is somebody else is prograe and then they are going to give us the next version and that is going to break our entire pipeline . you know . that is the main reason . yep . -h . yeah . the pr yeah . -h . yeah , i see what you mean , -h . the x_m_l_ file , the the g_f_ format . yeah , yeah . so yeah . yeah , i can imagine i can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do . that should be interesting . -h . six or . so -h . yeah . so so i suppose well , sounds good . . it is it is not . so yeah . , the actual right . yeah , fair enough . and if in doubt do not filter stuff out , keep it in , right . 'cause we always dp it to this other n_x_t_ track that we do not need to load necessarily . so the idea is you just keep stuff unless -h . enough . well -h . yeah yep . fair enough . okay , okay . oh yeah , and it is easy enough to dp stuff into an into separate track . w we gotta teach you about this at some point though . so but still not quite sure when . it sounds like maybe in another week . so jonathan made me promise not to tell you about it when you first arrived 'cause you were going to get overload about learning eye trackers and no . it is just too many things at once and it was not important that it be then . or or you leave very quickly . -h . like l looks yeah . so have start looking at that as the next stage . so yeah . he is a cool customer . he is ready for it . okay . i think we are done , right . . sorry ? oh yeah , i do not know . i do not really need to this just says look at the wiki . find out what is next . you could give give craig more work to do . this one is mine . it . . well , that will be something to do oh yeah , well that will take forever . . well well will the will the will that is that is really fun . check your batteries . i mean yeah , it says . and i have put you guys on yep . yeah . 'cause apar apar apparently p ? i really ? great . i was th so what would they is it sliding past ? . so i had so i had to bus people in from ah . yeah , yeah . go i we are glad they will look after yes . . i can still fifty six percent completed . skip it . 'cause i am just doing a b yeah , disk check or something . , right yep . is everything going smooth ? i in h . yeah , yeah . g it is yeah . no , i am just try i am trying to l think of . as long as it comes out in the end . that is . . yeah , well at this point . you are all fine . but there was a nber of nope , do not think so . . -h . 'cause . batteries . it is batteries we are waiting for . the they are they are due i i was told the beginning of this week . have you tried maplin ? are they expensive ? 'cause th they are quite strange . it is w r a avril has ordered them from somewhere possibly . n no . they are probably one fifty each or something like that . well hopefully . the they should have been here last week . but caroline then phoned up to chase them and they they were s they were told to be here . should be today . right , okay r b well we can still test whether camtasia runs anyway . it is just the whether it is the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check . the m yeah . when you get worried , go to maplin , okay . phone them first not yet , no . right . . fact right-o . find out whether they have it virtual . yep . to pick up stuff . w but then again right . but what we are here . i am a geek . i know where i know where maplin is yeah i i it how many batteries does this thing take ? does not take a hundred . yeah -h . it no , it is two batteries we need . , then yeah . and then suddenly discover yeah . you know this . no no . no . yes . check they got 'em first though . their stocks are a bit fair fair enough if you want . -h . not going to get anything out of it it is still probably even that angle . . ? cannot remember the wiki . d so all those tasks craig had when it started . his last day was the the only thing that well the thing that is holding s me slightly up is checking whether joe is f finished that there i there is a working model builder . but i am not sure if it is the finished finished version yet . and the the ninth yeah , no no . it is ours . yeah , it is yeah , he still had n hours left . i was not sure if it was down to the nber of hours or whether thirty first of october f certainly he right . . but no , he was billing for he was billing i think he is had something like seven . b but n i have n ni nijmegen has gone dead for all those last two weeks . was not ellen away ? they are really at the same place . well it w e e ellen is away . n no , but i think what they had was some big review . , yeah it could be it . oh , you a and so i have not heard anything back from them . so the models for ? so you use x_ fig to make the parts and then you this thing . oh okay . yep . yes , -h . well no . well we do not need to make the the parts are all the standard tangram ones i had before anyway . the x_ fig thing is only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes . but for this experiment it is just the tangram type task . ? i am not going to project my email . yeah , if you got right . i t i would say you do not be . okay how r f how recently that nothing i have not i heard anything from joe for a a week or so anyway . so cannot remember exactly when it was . yeah . that is that is newer than the yeah , yeah . screen shots . yeah , yeah . it is the last thing was in sp response to the thing i was saying last week about the parallelogram being the wrong way around and w from the model builder to the actual yeah . that nothing has i have not heard anything since from either sort of the netherlands or from you . . right . that suggests he is done done done . anyway yep . yeah . so oh , is he back ? oh is he ? oh no , right okay . to pop in for five yeah . yeah , it was after it was after that that there was the thing about w w why the parallelogram was the was a mirror image . we -h . yep . . right sure it does were hoping to get some yes . ah yeah , yeah . yes , or at l least she was meant to have have some idea of the level of complexity . 'cause they d they d have actually run things and to get an idea of the sort of style and to check that they would be alright . but all very quiet . what i do yeah . ach , try phone . when no , it has just been email rather than f f the telephone type of request . but oh right . so you i am down for a week . what is the seventh is a w a week today , i think . next week . yeah , or re change the schedule . right , okay . well i have not booked anybody in or anything . but that is when i am hoping . we have been of course put back a bit by the eye tracker going down . subjects , you are going to have d but we are we are needing we are certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of december , i think do not expect no . -h hopefully not . yeah . the only other slight complication is which will be b i think brought up at the meeting on thursday for all the eye tracking users . the lab has been block-booked again . jules from psychology . , they need to be serious about it . who have di or a student yep . lecturer . block book for how long ? -h . well presably not . but it is sort of quite solidly booked for f certainly w what six days from ten till five for two or three of those days . . it is just sometimes not . i would not i no i can probably at least email her and ask her if she is really needing it all that time . on thursday , right ? at the moment , there is just a booking system . yeah . i i well yeah , at the m yep . when people just if they can log on to it can book it . -h . appropriate use of the lab . i th in theory jast is meant to have it every morning . i no ? or in the software or anything but it there should not be any changes in the physical connections or or anything . no . yeah no . that as long as p other people do not for some reason , i do not know , disconnect some bits of the equipment , there is no reason why they should . it is just the yeah . it is on the w booking system . oh well . that is something . -h . well , most the time to to p yeah . so yes , it is it is on the p it is not on the booking system . it is on a web page that frank created about the lab . which i do not know if anybody actually knows is there . -h . . so yep . , you are oh and the model builders , yeah . oh yeah should should be . i have also got to get camtasia we well , yes the m the model builder . i have got to get camtasia working as a sort of little multi-media thing to generate a video of how to mi sort of a an instructional video . yeah . well -h . it is what i will have to do this week . then it will just be a matter h . , you were just g u . yeah , okay yep , yeah . have a look . if you th anything prob you will just t try out do that . yeah . i will i will do that . yeah , and just yeah . -h . . so if if you just put just put . work through them read 'em as and when i can . yeah . yeah yeah . -h have a look at hopef hopefully there is not a p a problem . but they said marloes was also meant to be checking it and doing things and quiet . ? so are you suddenly going to be well , what i am trying to get i have i it has not been divided up in that sort of way . but depends how quickly i manage to get a grip of it , how long it takes me to generate them or how i get on with the camtasia . . yeah yeah . . well -h . un unsure of yet . . yeah . if yeah . well you know me contingency planning and all this . i always worry about the worst . it it should not the there should not be any great problems . just checking that the they are of a suitable level of complexity or or of whatever . yeah . yeah . no quite quite right . yeah . so yeah . to do . which i guess you have to do . well yeah . yeah well you need to you you and marloes need to sort out , yeah . yeah . well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah . yeah , exactly . it is an offer to to get something . but yes . but presably whatever yep , book a time and i think so . right . well , i will try and get ahold of her again today and see what . -h . yeah . i d i would just hate for that i think it it was up till the end of october . so presably today they are now free again . or taking a week off to recover . yes . obvious yeah , okay , that is true . well that sounds that is quite a small thing she can do for you , i guess . you know well hopefully it it will not anyway . it is just if i then do it i hopefully will get the right models . that is that is the pro so it will be generated . it is whether the models are optimal or not that i think that is right . -h . must yep . . you are -h . at the analysis side of it . and that is yeah . -h . well so it was the whole all the dynamic region part of it that is . whatever -h . h . you do not record all day . -h . yeah . 'cause he might oh yeah , no no no , i understand that . it was it was more like oh , it was more like n no . well it depends how how many i can book in and get get running . yeah . and before my brain melts it but w when when the experiment is running , yeah , it is i will be in the lab . i cannot just go in , let them get start and then come back . it is so some people can , but yeah , yeah . just when he runs out of work ? yeah . so so we will worry about it then . th they will certainly be time because i am right next to the lab anyway , i will come back just to check my email and things anyway , so yeah . just . but -h . . -h . that they no . the part is built . so -h . not not pl not planning ? so how -h . right , so i would not bother more than one or two certainly . it is right . . and right . yeah , well that that is that is just x_m_l_ . so -h . w the real me meat of this yet to -h . yeah , we will yeah . well . so i do not think you will be twiddling your thbs , no . well at twelve o'clock next monday the lab is technically booked by jules . it were planning on . it starts the on we this wednesday and goes through to next wednesday . -h . what else ? yeah . my then other complication is two weeks tomorrow i start my teaching let us see , that is like the -h . for i have got two weeks of that , fo four lectures and four labs . yeah . that comes at . that is like the twentieth yes . for the first , yeah . yeah . . monday is the yeah . what is tomorrow , is the f tomorrow the f first ? so it will be the fifteenth for two weeks . my induction day . so oh you have got your induction , that is right . . 'cause people do ask . i mean i do not it is meant to be that in depth . it is yes yeah , on a scale of one to seven yes . from a total waste of time to , you know . . usual sort of stuff you get everywhere . so yeah yeah , you would be surpri these things do -h . it is probably the university will cover itself legally , i think , by doing this . -h . . , if they were going to do yeah . . i would and i would know somebody who would gone to know . you know . i am pretty sure they did not have induction in my day . so really no i suppose rather than being nobody is bothered so far , is it . well i do not remember being asked for an induction . so in april . can remo i got invited to a a a a smer garden party for new staff members . but that was but that is all . yeah , i can remember . before you could h . - . okay . yeah . seems reasonable . i have one n_x_t_ question which hopefully will not be well , it is not one . just hopefully as part of the output it will be something like that . is that correct ? so you have got the gaze position of the first person , gaze position of the second , mouse position of the first , mouse position of the second and , i do not know , a coon mouse action there or something . does that t just in in sort of layers like that . , they will yeah . that yep . presably . yeah , this is the easy stuff yes , -h . m that is that is just the the eye movement other sort of stuff , yeah . ? i mean that is just the way you want it . course there are lot lots of things that can it ho hopefu hopefully that is yeah , i guess it is that is why i dre the hard part . yeah . yeah , that is as well . yeah , -h . yeah . so i was just yeah , i was just checking that i know the language part because they say l_p_ here but this would be the the the new part . new stuff . yeah , whatever that is . oh so you do not want a pa part of this data ? aye . but i think you i think you should yes , i am not sure whether we need to know exactly where they are , just how many there are in each tra p i do not know . i suppose it could go in . i mean i suppose it we are as well to have it if we can . . but right . . so it is probably easier just to s shove 'em in . you can stick 'em in a different track well just say stick 'em in anyway . yeah . -h . ? is not blink a part of this ? -h . blink would at the moment just get lped in with the sort of previous gaze . . but but is not that -h . they are doing otherwise . so it may actually the way they are looking , -h . to smooth -h . m yes , -h . moving somewhere else , or is more likely to be i am thinking more that you wanna know about . oh blinking at the same time as the other person was doing something , i think to -h . yeah . . i was thinking more like , right . yes . norman normally would be just , as i say , like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation . 'cause you are not absorbing any new information and that is what the critical sort of deciding factor is . . and then you would not have blinks yes , so that they will include the tier if you are going to have it in . so i i yeah , would ha it would be as a separate tier where just to mark . yeah , so the the actual position . . and -h . w yeah , whether any what is included and what is n yeah . -h . that h . no , not certainly l not looking at codes , no . h . okay . . but -h . know what to look for and what not to , yeah . right . so tha tha that is that is for the rest of the ? they are already blink-corrected . i there are well they are already identified as blinks . then it is i it is at th h at what stage . the software that i have used p pools the blinks , so will add it on . i am not sure what the default software that comes the eye tracker . right . right , okay . well i i if if you want if you yes . yeah , so i am not su i certainly it is listed as a separate event in the stream . blinks are a tag from the e_d_f_ and and that sort of thing . it is registered as a a detection . but . so to remind me so to . -h . just checking the times th times of the events . i y yeah . i mean it it it will not because of the fixation it will be down to what we define as a gaze . so basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it . and so if they blinked a lot within that they are still looking at that object . so it is just the time in to the time out . whether that -h . in yep . for the eye tracker -h . wanna do it some different way . h . some other way . yes . in the in the docentation i have read through . yeah . but it could be these things -h . yep , there is a blink sort of event . -h . is what whether yep . . yeah it should just be a matter of treating a b adding on the blink to the last fixation or something anyway . oh right . yeah , you said well the the real reason is as long as they have been blinking , even if they then open their eyes somewhere else , that is when they start absorbing the new information . it is basically like a just a long saccade . it you kind of have visual suppression when you move and it is the same when you are blinking . you are not taking anything in . so okay . wait . okay . i kinda get this . yeah , yeah . -h . it it is yeah , that yes , that is for the sort of gaze time measure . it is not actually the fixations are still independent . so the they w fixation duration is not does not include the blink in the ascii a output . it is only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object , which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing . is it it is a a sort of composite viewing time . . i would forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object . yeah yeah , i am afraid -h . looking anything . and yep , yep . yeah , yeah . 'cause i although we will also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you you have got measure fixation duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move eye fixation or not . . -h . would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else . okay , okay . well tha tha do not do not worry well yep . to ye yeah , -h . viewing times . -h . . so i see this right , yeah . right . . yeah . -h . well that is partly why i brought this up now is it i am not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen . but that is what i want out in the end . right . yeah . well the n_x_t_ stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions . but there will be i suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do . i s presably with g_d_f_ . to before you hit before -h . you yeah -h . does is do this -h . h . . okay , okay 'cause you you h . c to n_x_t_ an oh yeah yeah . the germans do not yeah , yeah , yeah . fair enough , fair en yeah , so so , you know oh yeah . and yeah , that is also why i sent you the saarbruecken software f that the stuff that takes the ascii sort of format originally and then just sort of compresses it and things . yeah , the german stuff . because that little utility does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks , whether just to lp them in or or not . what the minim fixation duration for a stable fixation would be , sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds , you can tell it just to again lp them all together , that is not a sort of reliable enough fixation . you can put in these sort of of things . so that is that is a bit of software that is sent and that includes the source code and things as well . . fair enough , fair enough so -h . well it is good starting point , right . so it would be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do no , there is very little docentation as you might imagine for these sort of things . yeah , so i g i yeah . that is that is why . so -h . yeah , i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up -h . h . for us to sort to -h . fine . good . looking through that and make sure that works . 'cause yeah . yeah , yeah . i have l yeah i have no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well . so ah . -h . 'cause al also just filters it . there are a lot of strange event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless , i think . and it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk as well . so it cleans it up . -h . -h . , right right . yeah . well i use it that useful ? or no ? b fine . well possibly . . and simplified yep . -h . it is yeah . als well the pr pipeline . you know . that is yeah . -h . yeah , i see what you mean , -h . , the the . yeah -h . wanna do six or it with robin . so yeah . so so i suppose pose that that way the -h . well , sounds good . -h . it is it is not quite s it so it is not going to be quite grabbable 'cause it is it is written in java . mostly , yeah going to be the same . so yeah . yeah , well yes , -h , the actual . so -h . yeah , fair enough . well so so it is so long as it is x_m_l_ , n_x_t_ will -h . yeah . it is always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah . lossiness . 'cause you were going to get overload about learning eye trackers and no . it is just too many things at once and it was not important or or you leave very quickly . -h . yep . yep . well i am i am . sorry ? oh yeah oh dear . my page is blank still . . find . this one is mine i guess not .

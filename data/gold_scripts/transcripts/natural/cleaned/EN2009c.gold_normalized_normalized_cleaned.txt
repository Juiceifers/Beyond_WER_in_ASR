yeah well find a way and ive put yeah well i was expecting to get yeah though and i did did make it in time but it just just cause all the leaves and things the stra the trains werent stopping at the stations so they decided to put speed restrictions on really is it sliding yep yeah cause apar apar apparently p im not sure the and theyre bussing people into station have particular problems on it cause its on a cause its on a hill or something so i had so i had to bus people in from like stations either side yes yes but yeah at l at least it was speed restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things so really great i was th so whatd they have to do back up ah nasty yeah yeah go i were glad yes oh f yeah okay yeah disk check gonna discover cause everythings well you know apa pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get camtasia sorted out oh everything going smooth yeah i havent i havent added anything to the wiki recently so cause ive weve been been working on trying to get the x_m_l_ stuff working so some the ba basically they only had to how the dom works so i can do the next so i can ge generate d_d_f_ files so so th yeah so just just been reading through docentation thats what i was doing the end of last week just so i know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things but im at the moment ive ive been playing with the dom stuff in mozilla cause i cause ju just so at least i can see how it works with the h_t_m_l_ pages so i can generate the x_ so i can generate x_h_t_m_l_ stuff and see how it all works there just cause to just see how things work in that and oh yeah the oh well it well thing is that the a_ the a_ well the a_p_i_ is standardized by the w_ three c_ so the a_p_i_ is stan is standard between everything idea so yeah yeah well y or that i dont wanna name who dont always get yeah yeah yeah it is it it just has a couple of yeah yeah well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that so i was doing the is anyway its ju its just that thats thats quite a quick way to just to get into how how works because i can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah add things to and take things away and dont see exactly whats going on at the time so so okay i believe you now its a good strategy h oh well just cause x_h_t_m_l_ has a nice you know you got browsers there so you can actually see you can actually see directly whats whats going on yeah but most m most yeah well ill im using x_h_t_m_l_ to deter thats all all the web pages are x_h_t_m_l_ so its x_m_l_ just with the h_t_m_l_ d_t_d_ yeah ju ju ju just ba just cause we havent we havent f havent quite finalised the the g_d_f_ format so just just well just okay so all youre gonna have to yeah yeah so all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so its yeah yeah okay ev everybodys got their different ways of doing these things im yeah yeah no im just try yeah yeah but but yeah that sounds that what what what what im doing the moment im looking through the s the stuff that robin put on the wiki to say whats you know what what we need in the in the t in the output format for the for the task you know so what what youre what youre gonna do the analysis on so im making sure that i can take get that information out of the g_d_f_ as it st state of the moment and if i find something that you cant get out of it then i can add that to the add that to the g_d_f_ format so yeah as a yeah yeah and it wasnt yeah well the view at this point so y are you working well im im im ju try im making sure that the g_d_f_ format weve got at the moment will d will output say well ive output old analysis that that robins looking for so so im using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the dom things as well so yeah so at the moment im looking at act actually the g_d_f_ format itself and then to generate the g_d_f_ format im gonna be taking stuff out of the gest analyser and then using a dom parser to generate x_m_l_ output from the gest analyser so the data format translation oh okay so you havent looked at whats no no but ill when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already which is what ill m plan to use that as the basis for it cause that already that already picks up like target regions things like that so you get so so it knows whether youre looking at a part or whether youre looking at target area or what or whatever so yes as long as it got that in it somewhere so its just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the into the g_d_f_ stuff not yet oh okay yeah okay so yep right yeah bu and im not sure what else yeah yeah i i think the o the only thing ive got left to do before the experiments can be run is get s is get the check camtasia works now ive got camtasia running on machines and i think theyre set up correctly but i cant test it until we get the microphones working microphones until you get the h cause its ah well he must some these days anyway isnt it so so oh yeah of course yeah so we all got off easy so its even yeah ah well ca i can easy i can easy get to mapl to maplin i know where it is off i used to live there so i know i know where i used to live here im a geek i know where i know where maplin is know your way around ah yeah oh yeah c yeah yeah i just think well i i yeah yeah no well i suppose i could gi i could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi its not been in your in your f pigeon hole i can easy go off the train and early and just pick em up from there right yeah well ill make sure i make a ill make sure of i got the f the phone nber in my phone so i can call them all true true its dalry road isnt it anything out of it so wasnt ellen yep i t id say you dont be how r f how recently that yeah yeah screen shots yeah yeah builder to the actual yeah oh so h eighth well im im using dice machines if he wants to pop in for five minutes the the windows machine is free for him at the moment well hes just not yeah after it was yeah i mean i considering we get an email from the i think it got sent through saying that hed updated the the whatever it was on the wiki so you do hed hed uploaded a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one so yeah h yep yep yeah most the time yeah these yeah well when the whole thing was if it was gonna run a trial thatll give you some some screen shots to work with and then itll just be a matter of adding new video f mouse movements or whatever so h have a look if you th anything prob any problems with it think theres a wiki page up for that f for that piece of for yeah for that thing so if if you just put just put whatever recoendations bugs on that page and ill work through them read em as and when i can h have a look at yeah marloes yeah yeah yeah and like these yeah i mean ive used the software and theres not that hard i mean it it shouldnt yeah well you of and all this if quite quite right yeah so well i cant imagine the building the building the mold is gonna be that hard i mean i can easily just well however many thousands are on that dutch web site you found just you know pick pick some of them redo them in in the ja in the j_c_d_ format thats yeah its pretty mechanical i can easily d easily do that so but its a matter of choosing which ones you need to do which i guess you have to do well yeah yeah well you need to you you and marloes need to sort out yeah yeah well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah yeah to recover yes i dont think dont think so i mean so the the major thing ive gotta d got to do is get this camtasia sorted out so just waiting for the batteries for that if robins not worried im not worried youre gonna run h p the g_d_f_ yeah yeah cause ill go gotta finalise that format and then once thats done ive gotta start looking at the analysis side of it and thats h well so it was the whole yeah yeah but yeah yeah i think yeah no the the analysis i think the analysis will take a little while i dont think its gonna take that long to get its stuff sorted out its gonna be how to display it and all that sort of stuff whatever makes it easiest for you to do but once w yeah its just what im worrying it w worried h h oh yeah start yeah yeah yeah so i still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a g_d_f_ outputter and oh yeah and ill i can have a look at the model builder as well cause one thing im thinking about is w were looking at the the part building pa type stuff and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the model builder just just the ju i just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway the j_c_t_ parts from from s_v_g_s yeah so well worry about it then h yeah yeah what i do dont know is we wanna bother with a part builder i mean the idea yeah yeah yeah but ill wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it cause if if i can use it to generate the rotsym angle for example and the rotation syetry stuff for it which is what was causing the bugs before so if i if i can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and itll d save a few bugs so right yeah yeah yeah or do y m yeah but now now h h no its its just something you gotta remember once the parts been built so so yeah h yeah yeah well im not not not pl not planning do much on that its just right so how how many h yeah i mean ive ive already ive already got this yeah yeah cause it really isnt worth it you you yeah other i saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list youll have to learn about so its its not like youre out of work right right yeah well that thats thats just x_m_l_ to x_m_l_ to x_m_l_ isnt it turning g_d_f_ and what other bits into n_x_t_ so oh yeah yeah yeah but you know theres h w yeah yeah it takes standoff right right yeah cause thats the yeah o other than you have from what ive heard about it is both x_m_l_ so the the prograing side of it doesnt sound too hard its gonna be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format so but no thats thats fine ill d ill have try to find ill ill have plen plenty of plenty of questions for you once i once i get to the last stage im sure and you know theres stuff to learn there so yeah yeah yep so yeah yeah yeah well find yeah well yeah well the were gonna get camtasia sorted out this week and then its concentrate on the on the gest analyzer the g_d_f_ stuff and then yeah once once weve done that its whatever whatever you whate whatever you whatever you want me do once i done the once ive done the g_d_f_ i guess okay twiddling your thbs no yep yeah so i think the g_d_f_ will keep me busy for a little while yet so yeah well thats yeah certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage i guess yeah yep okay h yeah for the first yeah yeah so it will be h actually yeah that reminds me i wo wo i wo i wont be on thursday im gonna be over in my induction day so so oh youve got your induction thats right fair enough fair enough i mean i dont its meant to be that in depth its yeah yes from a total waste of time to you know yes yes i mean i d i dont expect to be that in depth i mean its fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics so its just its it is yes it is im sure most of it i already know its like fire safety yeah health safety data protection usual sort of stuff you get everywhere so yeah yeah h its probably yeah yeah well if they were yeah im pretty sure is it yeah i mean i can remo i got invited to a for new staff members but that was but yeah i can remember when i start being a st when i was sta starting being a student i mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching and you couldnt do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room so oh yeah h so but yeah im not sure im not sure why the why why im doing it now but okay so see how it go ill ill give you my report on friday or something yep u yeah seems fine okay know so so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then it right so tha tha thats thats for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker isnt the analyzer software that comes the eye tracker the default yes yeah as a separate right are right okay well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the g_d_f_ stuff so to remind me so to to just add that analysis to yeah to to it so its i mean its easy enough to do just che just checking the times th times of the events yeah a detection but h i y yeah i mean it it it wont right okay okay yeah but what we yeah yeah cause i think the ascii format as it stands does contain blink information cause d d im sure im sure thats appeared in the in the docentation ive read through yes h yep possibly possibly yeah you know it it treats it as a right okay okay yeah so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ascii format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis cause ive gotta do the analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway so yeah i d i i i didnt think check for blinks during that isnt gonna be a shouldnt be a big problem yep it yeah yep so well be if theyre not right h and so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time youre looking at this object between this time this time youre not looking anything and yep yep yeah yeah cause i think i think at the moment the g_d_f_ format has fixations in it so so i gue i guess thatd be part of the g_d_f_ to transformation would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else okay okay well tha tha dont dont worry about that just the moment but well its not okay h yep to ye yeah h viewing times right right so so so w will you actually be doing much of the g_d_f_ or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the n_x_t_ stuff then so whe when you when you actually generate your results h right yeah yeah c well yeah you told that earlier cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the g_d_f_ stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff so you can get some some results anyway cant you okay yeah yeah i mean it to some extent it h h right okay okay cause you you h c right oh yeah yeah the germans dont yeah yeah yeah sort of compresses it and things yeah the german stuff fair enough fair en you can put yeah so so they they were allowed to do whatever without without source code theres no c sort of restrictions on that fair enough fair enough so h yeah i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up some docentation on it thatll gi thatll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things yeah easy c yeah create all the switches and whatever else you need to do so h h h okay okay yeah so well on once yeah well once ive had once ive had a bit of bit more look at this g_d_f_ stuff then start looking through that start looking through that and make sure that works cause h cause al also yeah can stri it yeah yeah ive l yeah ive no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well so but as ah well b but we dont wanna as well so it cleans it up h yeah well i use it that useful for generating this g_d_f_ stuff i can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when im do doing the g_d_f_ stuff so yeah im just thinking yeah yeah i mean but what yeah say what what ill what ill plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software find out what functions are useful for us in that and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the x_m_l_ file the the g_f_ format yeah yeah i can imagine h yeah yeah so so the fir fir first part thatll be docenting what theyve got and then discussing it with robin so yeah so so i suppose pose that that way the well sounds good h its its not quite s it so its right but yeah well i tr mo mostly yeah im sure i sure most the logics gonna be gonna be the same so yeah yeah well yes the actual right yeah fair enough the idea is you yeah fair enough well so so its so long as its x_m_l_ n_x_t_ will handle it wont it cause h yeah lossiness yep fair enough but still not quite sure okay okay so cause you were gonna get overload no yeah well im well im well g ive got the hang of all the stuff ive been going through and it looks like l looks like im coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already so im gonna have start looking at that as the next stage so yeah so yeah hes a cool customer hes ready for it yep well really need find well i ma i ma i may be maybe i want to check out these batteries and things wont i so tomorrow well thatll be something to do well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today so this ones mine it oh yeah well thatll take forever thats thats really fun check your batteries i guess not yeah yeah i mean if youre ever you know late cause of that its not well find a way around it and ive put you guys on mondays at this time for my convenience but its not like its important that yeah it says to put speed restrictions really yep yeah cause apar apar apparently p i really great i was th so whatd they have to do back up problems on so i had so i had to bus ah nasty yeah yeah go i were glad theyll look after that bit yes i dont know do we wanna look at anything its not up yet still fifty i can oh i dont know what its doing oops that fell off doesnt like silk stay and now were gonna discover weve got no reason to meet right cause everythings going swiingly yep well you know apa pa apart from apart all oh yeah i cause i havent been i havent read the wikis in my email since i left so so oh yeah and it well thing is that the oh well i dont know the mozilla stuff so if it turns out that its idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits then it wont have been a good idea so everything or yeah yeah yeah it is it it just has a couple of yeah yeah well y th there are certain companies that i dont wanna name who dont always get it right i c but m yeah mozilla yeah itll be alright so okay i believe you now its a good strategy its ju its h wh why does it help that its x_t_ h_t_m_l_ instead of just x_m_l_ directly whats whats going on yeah but most m most browsers when when you put an x_m_l_ file up in it itll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you yeah ju ju okay yeah just well just yeah yeah so all have to okay so all youre gonna have to do is swap in tag names later okay yeah yeah ev everybodys got their different ways of doing these things im sure thats fine like having to g its h as long as it comes yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah no im just try im trying to l think of the things that could go wrong but since i havent tried it this particular way you know but yeah that sounds good so i so you say we havent finalised what the g_d_f_ looks like is that an implicit request for me to do something or if i find something so yeah yeah yeah as a well i mean theres two two cases in here right theres things you can get straight off the original format and then theres things you have to do some kind of postprocessing of the original format but its not just a data format change its actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well right and it wasnt y i think it was a little bit confused last time we spoke about whether yeah well the well im im im ju try u whether you consider g_d_f_ format to be the thing thats just the straightforward translations of whats in the original eyetracking output or whether like whether the postprocessing utilities are a separate step cause i think you and i had separate different views on this but i cant remember w who had which view at this point so y are you working actively on this anal these analysis things or you just working on the translation so the data format translation x_m_l_ output from the gest analyser no no but ill when oh okay so you havent looked at whats in there and what isnt in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do not yet oh okay that already that already yeah stuff yep yeah bu okay so this sounds like its under control and youre happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know so i dont need to do anything right youre all fine but there was a nber of things that came before this right that it sounds like theyre not under control yet so so you know the g_d_f_ stuff with so i ellens view on this is we go through everything in order like the priority is exactly the pipeline order right so camtasia you mentioned and im not sure what else but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do nope dont think so microphones cause until you get the oh microphones batteries the theyre theyre due okay are they really really strange batteries have you tried maplin are they expensive possibly cause you know like a wee bus journey over to maplin might solve the problem if its getting in the way so this isnt actually ruining your schedule for anything and thats why youre waiting right okay it is i so it sounds like youre not actually worried about the fact that this is the m yeah when you get worried go to maplin okay phone them first to make sure that theyre in there somebody around must have a probably steve somebody in the techie group will have a maplin catalogue fact ill see if i can yeah its useful to know whos got a current one anyway i dont seem to get them anymore i guess i dont buy enough equipment to check not yet no right righto so oh yeah of course d so you can find out whether they have it but youd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there i actually live not that far from there so virtual yep yeah so we all got off easy yeah it would be a half hour diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff w but then again its also very close to haymarket so its even less of a diversion for you probably except you dont know your way around right but what were used to live there so i know i know where ah yeah oh yeah c yeah yeah i just think well you know for the sake of three quid or however many quid it how many batteries does this thing take doesnt take a hundred h it no yeah then you know put your mind at rest yeah cause you know you wouldnt want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording and then suddenly discover yeah you know this no no no yes check they got em first though their stocks are a bit funny down there enough if you want h all true true cause you know its not that attractive an area to walk through if youre not gonna get anything out of it so of all the things that were on the wiki do i need to pull up the wiki ah it is gonna let me log in no i do not wanna change my password but you guys probably know off the top of your head is there anything else that we we we were waiting on before you could run cant remember so all those tasks craig had when it started the only thing that well the thing thats holding his last day was the thirty first of october the the ninth yeah no no its ours yeah its ours oh so hes got ours lefthes behindhand but no he was billing for he was billing by the hour so i thought well i mean obviously if he wants to finish off then you know i b certainly he right i think hes had something like seven but n oh well theyre probably away then wasnt ellen away theyre really at the same place it w e e ellens away n no oh yeah it could be it a and oh you have no models at all oh thats a pity model buil builder thats what i was calling the graphical model editor right so you use x_ fig to make the parts and then you this thing yes well no well we dont need to oh okay the x_ fig things yep yep okay i have something in my email about from joe he wouldnt have sent it just to me would he do you want me to check that im not gonna project my email yeah if you got right okay i think i mighta heard thursday or something i cant remember exactly when it was yeah thats oh h okay so ive got something on the twenty eighth thats friday i think oh he just wants to know how to get paid right that suggests hes done done done anyway hes in edinburgh so well i suppose he wont come by cause craigs on his desk yep yeah so is he oh no right okay free for him at the moment well hes just not gonna try to le squat there thats all well i so the last thing ive got from him about work work was the nineteenth of october that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted thats oh so you didnt get that it was me and him but presably the he put it on the wiki so so hes just telling us cause he things we probably dont read wikis and ill just check the old one so yeah well i i havent replied to him about yeah i really dont have anything more more recent from him s i havent replied to him about yep you know how to submit costs and stuff like that so but that suggests hes at at the end of things but w we could just ask him i mean maybe you guys would just wanna ask him directly youre done done right cause its worth you guys knowing and then of course any problems that remain you inherit right you know its worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want i guess so th the problem is you want you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from marloes yes yes ah yeah yeah things and to right have you you tried coldcalling her thats what i do when i need things that yeah ach try phone request when i if you get em today when are you gonna start running oh right so you have to be you have to be ready by then next week yeah or re change the schedule i havent booked anybody in or anything right okay we yeah makes sense yep subjects youre gonna have d but were were needing yeah so s y y you dont have subjects lined up but you dont expect any trouble getting them no h yeah by i dont know this person so they well they need to be serious about it who whos their is that a staff member or a student okay well we kinda paid for the lab so it depends but i suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it is it a have di yep right i mean presably he or she is not running subjects the entire block book for how long quite solidly booked from so ellens still out of town right its just y you could try calling this person and see how this works ellen might be more persuasive its just sometimes academic staff have a bit of a chip about research staff and since i dont know the person i cant tell whether its one of those or not i h yeah and then escalate i guess but you know or whether they can be put off for a little bit or something so i have no idea how the booking system works well youre discussing it on thursday right at the moment theres just a booking system yeah i i well yeah at the m yep yep well thats thats one to raise at the meeting i v might talk to ellen about that ahead of time cause they may have she and martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab h i th in oh really yeah but i g dont you guys set up for isnt blockbooking more appropriate because i i isnt there setup involved in changing around for somebody else no or in the software or anything okay anything no so theres no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons yeah s so in the worst case you may be able to make an argent if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week is this something thats known outside ellens head its just the its on the w booking system its on the p oh well thats something which i dont know if yeah well most the time to to p yeah so it sounds like youve got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need of course try to be kind to other people but you would anyway so h yep so those are the only things that are worrying you camtasia and lab access and otherwise no sweat youre happy oh and the model builders yeah we well oh yeah h these this is gonna take a little while yeah h yeah but you were gonna try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that or no you were just g really gonna run a video of the sep of the trial yeah okay thats thats much easier u yep yeah so with the modelbuilder what do you need to do with it th the which one you is gonna look at what it does so far and youll just t try out do that yeah ill ill do that yeah and just yeah yeah hopefully yeah yeah how many models were you relying on her for so are you suddenly gonna be ive i been divided well what im trying to get at is is your start time gonna be delayed cause you dont have the models ready if she doesnt come through way but yeah yeah well h un can you draft craig in to build some if necessary yeah if yeah well you know me contingency planning and all this i always worry about the worst or or of whatever yeah yeah no quite quite right yeah so yeah you can call a jast telcon between you and marloes you know i if its not that see you know with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether theyre alive and get an an offer to to get something but you know the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this were gonna talk about it you know tuesday at such such a time unless you yes book a time but presably whatever it is theyve been going through is now over and see what i think h yeah i d today theyre now free again or taking a week id just hate for that to c to slow you up in collecting stuff thats all obvious yeah okay thats true well that sounds thats thats the pro so it will be generated its thats quite a small thing she can do for you i guess you know its not like you know w sitting there brain deadly constructing you know some models that she needs to do its just to provide advice about this which must take take less time or not that i think thats right h yep well that all sounds fine you guys worried about it you worried about anything weve mostly been talking about the experiment schedule so p youre gonna run out of things to f do that we havent set you up for any time soon the g_d_f_ sounds like it might take a wee while yeah but you dont need anything from me for that cause thats already sorta speced i mean again thats the pair of you for you to do but once w yeah its just what im worrying it w worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis on or something cause youre gonna be completely unavailable when youre recording or will there be times when you dont record all day get h yeah cause he might oh yeah no no no i understand that it was it was more like oh it was more like you know you so this week hes got you know the g_d_f_ stuff to do then next week youre planning on recording and what happens if suddenly youre unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of work i cant just go in let them get start and then come back its so some people can but th theyll certainly yeah yeah yeah so so well worry about it then my email and things anyway so yeah and h yeah cause yeah from s_v_g_s yeah yeah what i do dont know is we wanna bother with a part builder i mean the idea was it wasnt worth the investment right for it which is what was causing the bugs before so if i if i can use the model yeah yeah yeah or do y h itll d save a few bugs so no its its just something m yeah but now now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the rotsym some stuff do they have do you have trouble doing it no so no yeah yeah well im not not not pl not planning do much on that its just yeah well g i mean we might want to severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder right so how how many person days would it be worth like if craig discovered it could be done in x_ days h yeah i mean ive ive already ive already got this yeah yeah other i saw saw saw saw something about right so theres your limit dont spend more than a day or two on it yeah cause it really isnt worth it you you have to understand theres things about this project weve hidden from you so far that youll have to learn about so its its not like youre out of work right right yeah well oh really oh that onell just be a little addon thatll whatever it is itll be the same skills as youve learned for something else and itll just be im not even sure thats you cause i think somebody else is doing that actually but im thinking more of the fact that at some point we should probably tell you about this n_x_t_ stuff so h and what other bits into n_x_t_ yeah yeah right right yeah cause thats the yeah oh yeah yeah yeah but you know theres x_m_l_ and x_m_l_ and you know it takes standoff links and stuff and its some some people if theyre not used to linguistic annotation c it c take a little time to get their head around the way the do data data model works and you know theres stuff to learn there so expect out of the format so yeah yeah yep thats thats fine so yeah yeah yeah well yeah so just dont witter away you know weeks on fripperies when weve got the real me meat of this yet to come well find well find plenty of really really crucial s things for you to do so h i i guess okay so ill remind myself to look at whats next before the next time we get together guess yeah so you collect on monday that means you dont wanna meet right oh r right its actually next week its actually the week that you were planning on it it starts oh okay well i dont know anyway youll tell me whether it we cancel this or whether i just talk to craig in which case we wont be up here cause we dont record twos h oh yeah that should be fun lets see thats like the for ive got two weeks of that fo that comes at an ideal time for you then thats like the twentieth or something i cant add monday is the whats tomorrow is the yeah for oh yeah you have to promise to tell us how that is cause people do ask me yes yes yeah on a scale of one to seven know its yeah yeah youd be surpri these things do probably the universityll cover itself yeah yeah yeah well if they were gonna do that then theyd force you to go to it i would and i would know somebody whod gone to know you know im pretty sure they didnt have induction in my day so no i suppose rather than being nobodys bothered so far is it really but you only started here they were supposed to im sure oh well cause you were the responsible oh yeah yep so see how it go ill h okay which hopefully yeah does seems reasonable layers like that so itll be like in monitor but yeah theyll all be different tiers like that and then theres the language stuff as well presably yeah yep yes m thats yeah this is the easy stuff yeah well eyes and mouse eyes and mice other sort of stuff yeah and thats enough for you right i mean thats just the way you want it course there are lot lots of things that can do that but its the language part thats the hard part yeah it ho hopefu hopefully thats yeah i guess its thats why i dre as well yeah h yeah yeah thats the the new yeah that seems fine yeah do you know what the the sets of codes are well the whatev whatever whatever youre getting out of the jast analyser so i mean blinks as well right oh so you dont want a pa part of this data tra aye but i suppose it could go in i think you i think you should well theres two views on this if you do then the people formulating research questions will ask about them but if you dont theyll probably ask about them anyway and then youll have to add em after the fact so its probably easier just to s shove em in you can stick em in a different track and and then load em or not load em as you please cause its not well i dont know with is it is it part of so th these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time right isnt blink a part of this were as well to have it if we can right well just say stick em in anyway yeah h h yeah but but isnt that important because when theyre blinking basically its like an a nil code you c cant find out what theyre doing otherwise so it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that youre doing so it could be that if they only they hadnt had a blink just then they wouldve been i dont know what h the way theyre looking h h im thinking more blinking at the same time that you wanna know about oh i hope n not to much relies on missing stuff cause people blink i was thinking more like you know the person looks a p a part and theyve got a fixation before and after and theres blink in the middle and you know there may be times when you wanna treat that as one thing right h yeah yes norman oh right okay so but in that case cause right in that case then these tiers are already like blink corrected and then you wouldnt have blinks as part of this youd want blinks as a separate tier if youre gonna have it in yes so that theyll include the so i i yeah would ha it yeah yeah so the key thing is he here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive and the second key thing is it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes w yeah whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that cause you know it wouldnt necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes that the actual position h whats included and whats n yeah h h yeah i suppose if you know about eye trackers then youll just know but h it i think youre just saying it comes out of the eye tracker already right theyre already blinkcorrected i there enough to do just yeah okay okay yeah but what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye tracking stuff where it does that and whether that gets through so that craig gets it automatically in what hes translating or to g_d_f_ whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker or whether we even like it right and wanna do it some different way h yep h h some other way possibly possibly yeah yeah but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus theres blink information so you know it it treats it as a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are cause as they were saying they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something so sort of event h well be if theyre not still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink then why is that is that the right thing to do analytically oh right yeah you said that well but does the duration of fixations count for anything cause it if youre just adding the length of the blink to the fixation youre not treating it as a saccade okay duration wait its only okay i kinda get this yeah yeah h is it its a a sort of composite viewing so more complicated than i thought id forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object yeah okay yeah im afraid h dont worry about that just the moment but well its not okay i mean this is kinda what we were talking about before this confusion about whats in the g_d_f_ i mean you might see it as the initial g_d_f_ is just whatever straightforwardly translates without you know without transforms with just the data format changing from the ascii and then theres a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in augmented g_d_f_ format you know like this blink and the gaze and whatever else and then you translate to n_x_t_ so you might still wanna have everything in this one g_d_f_ file format that represents everything and then the n_x_t_ thing is just a splitter its not doing any fancy analysis so i see this as you know a bunch of little routines that take the the g_d_f_ without this information in it and add new information into th subscript versions of the g_d_f_ file that contains these postprocess analyses h right yeah h yeah yeah stuff with okay yeah right yeah i mean it to some extent it doesnt matter which data format its in n_x_t_ or g_d_f_ but it makes more sense for the converter between g_d_f_ and n_x_t_ not to add any data all it does is do this this stupid data format conversion and it its just you know separating it out in the little steps so you know there have to be these other scripts that add any data transforms not data format transform forms but data transforms like this idea of of putting together gazes from fixations so y you know i if we keep it simpler like that so that its in little pieces then itll be just easier to understand w what the wh the whole thing does h h okay okay right cause you you c you know i if suddenly you discover theres a problem with the g_d_f_ to n_x_t_ transform you wanna know whether its one of these little postprocesses going wrong or whether its just the thing that dps it into the multiple files for the and g_d_f_ to n_x_t_ transform is c is pretty simple so you know h c an and oh yeah them in or or enough so thats like all the analysis that you need to do to things are you just gonna copy what they do or is it docented like why they did it they way they did it or is it just well its good starting point right so itd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do things of things yeah so i g i yeah thats thats why so h yeah yeah ah well but as well b but we dont wanna build it into our data path we just wanna learn from it i think right correct or no right b fine stuff so yeah im just thinking you know like i so this takes the ascii to to a d simplified ascii and simplified in with transforms in it ascii and its just it seems to be harder to maintain something thats got that in it if itd be better to break things up into like steps that you know as part of the the and als well why do i think this i dont know because its somebody elses prograe and then theyre gonna give us the next version and thats gonna break our entire pipeline you know thats the main reason yep h yeah the pr yeah yeah i see what you mean the x_m_l_ file the the g_f_ format yeah yeah so yeah yeah i can imagine i can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do that should be interesting h six or so yeah so so i suppose well sounds good its its not so yeah the actual right yeah fair enough and if in doubt dont filter stuff out keep it in right cause we always dp it to this other n_x_t_ track that we dont need to load necessarily so the idea is you just keep stuff unless h enough well h yeah yep fair enough okay okay oh yeah and its easy enough to dp stuff into an into separate track w we gotta teach you about this at some point though so but still not quite sure when it sounds like maybe in another week so jonathan made me promise not to tell you about it when you first arrived cause you were gonna get overload about learning eye trackers and no its just too many things at once and it wasnt important that it be then or or you leave very quickly like l looks yeah so have start looking at that as the next stage so yeah hes a cool customer hes ready for it okay i think were done right sorry oh yeah i dont know i do not really need to this just says look at the wiki find out whats next you could give give craig more work to do this ones mine it well thatll be something to do oh yeah well thatll take forever well well will the will the will thats thats really fun check your batteries i mean yeah it says and ive put you guys on yep yeah cause apar apar apparently p i really great i was th so whatd they is it sliding past so i had so i had to bus people in from ah yeah yeah go i were glad theyll look after yes i can still fifty six percent completed skip it cause im just doing a b yeah disk check or something right yep is everything going smooth i in h yeah yeah g its yeah no im just try im trying to l think of as long as it comes out in the end thats yeah well at this point youre all fine but there was a nber of nope dont think so h cause batteries its batteries were waiting for the theyre theyre due i i was told the beginning of this week have you tried maplin are they expensive cause th they are quite strange its w r a avril has ordered them from somewhere possibly n no theyre probably one fifty each or something like that well hopefully the they shouldve been here last week but caroline then phoned up to chase them and they they were s they were told to be here should be today right okay r b well we can still test whether camtasia runs anyway its just the whether its the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check the m yeah when you get worried go to maplin okay phone them first not yet no right fact righto find out whether they have it virtual yep to pick up stuff w but then again right but what were here im a geek i know where i know where maplin is yeah i i it how many batteries does this thing take doesnt take a hundred yeah h it no its two batteries we need then yeah and then suddenly discover yeah you know this no no no yes check they got em first though their stocks are a bit fair fair enough if you want h not gonna get anything out of it its still probably even that angle cant remember the wiki d so all those tasks craig had when it started his last day was the the only thing that well the thing thats holding s me slightly up is checking whether joes f finished that there i there is a working model builder but im not sure if its the finished finished version yet and the the ninth yeah no no its ours yeah its yeah he still had n hours left i wasnt sure if it was down to the nber of hours or whether thirty first of october f certainly he right but no he was billing for he was billing i think hes had something like seven b but n ive n ni nijmegen has gone dead for all those last two weeks wasnt ellen away theyre really at the same place well it w e e ellens away n no but i think what they had was some big review yeah it could be it oh you a and so i havent heard anything back from them so the models for so you use x_ fig to make the parts and then you this thing oh okay yep yes well no well we dont need to make the the parts are all the standard tangram ones i had before anyway the x_ fig things only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes but for this experiment its just the tangram type task im not gonna project my email yeah if you got right i t id say you dont be okay how r f how recently that nothing i havent i heard anything from joe for a a week or so anyway so cant remember exactly when it was yeah thats thats newer than the yeah yeah screen shots yeah yeah its the last thing was in sp response to the thing i was saying last week about the parallelogram being the wrong way around and w from the model builder to the actual yeah that nothing has i havent heard anything since from either sort of the netherlands or from you right that suggests hes done done done anyway yep yeah so oh is he back oh is he oh no right okay to pop in for five yeah yeah it was after it was after that that there was the thing about w w why the parallelogram was the was a mirror image we h yep right sure it does were hoping to get some yes ah yeah yeah yes or at l least she was meant to have have some idea of the level of complexity cause they d they d have actually run things and to get an idea of the sort of style and to check that theyd be alright but all very quiet what i do yeah ach try phone when no it has just been email rather than f f the telephone type of request but oh right so you im down for a week whats the seventh is a w a week today i think next week yeah or re change the schedule right okay well i havent booked anybody in or anything but thats when im hoping we have been of course put back a bit by the eye tracker going down subjects youre gonna have d but were were needing were certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of december i think dont expect no h hopefully not yeah the only other slight complication is which will be b i think brought up at the meeting on thursday for all the eye tracking users the lab has been blockbooked again jules from psychology they need to be serious about it who have di or a student yep lecturer block book for how long well presably not but its sort of quite solidly booked for f certainly w what six days from ten till five for two or three of those days its just sometimes not i wouldnt i no i can probably at least email her and ask her if shes really needing it all that time on thursday right at the moment theres just a booking system yeah i i well yeah at the m yep when people just if they can log on to it can book it h appropriate use of the lab i th in theory jast is meant to have it every morning i no or in the software or anything but it there shouldnt be any changes in the physical connections or or anything no yeah no that as long as p other people dont for some reason i dont know disconnect some bits of the equipment theres no reason why they should its just the yeah its on the w booking system oh well thats something well most the time to to p yeah so yes its its on the p its not on the booking system its on a web page that frank created about the lab which i dont know if anybody actually knows is there h so yep youre oh and the model builders yeah oh yeah should should be ive also got to get camtasia we well yes the m the model builder ive got to get camtasia working as a sort of little multimedia thing to generate a video of how to mi sort of a an instructional video yeah well h its what ill have to do this week then itll just be a matter h you were just g u yeah okay yep yeah have a look if you th anything prob youll just t try out do that yeah ill ill do that yeah and just yeah h so if if you just put just put work through them read em as and when i can yeah yeah yeah have a look at hopef hopefully theres not a p a problem but they said marloes was also meant to be checking it and doing things and quiet so are you suddenly gonna be well what im trying to get ive i it hasnt been divided up in that sort of way but depends how quickly i manage to get a grip of it how long it takes me to generate them or how i get on with the camtasia yeah yeah well h un unsure of yet yeah if yeah well you know me contingency planning and all this i always worry about the worst it it shouldnt the there shouldnt be any great problems just checking that the theyre of a suitable level of complexity or or of whatever yeah yeah no quite quite right yeah so yeah to do which i guess you have to do well yeah yeah well you need to you you and marloes need to sort out yeah yeah well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah yeah exactly its an offer to to get something but yes but presably whatever yep book a time and i think so right well ill try and get ahold of her again today and see what h yeah i d id just hate for that i think it it was up till the end of october so presably today theyre now free again or taking a week off to recover yes obvious yeah okay thats true well that sounds thats quite a small thing she can do for you i guess you know well hopefully it it wont anyway its just if i then do it i hopefully will get the right models thats thats the pro so it will be generated its whether the models are optimal or not that i think thats right h must yep youre h at the analysis side of it and thats yeah h well so it was the whole all the dynamic region part of it thats whatever h h you dont record all day yeah cause he might oh yeah no no no i understand that it was it was more like oh it was more like n no well it depends how how many i can book in and get get running yeah and before my brain melts it but w when when the experiments running yeah its ill be in the lab i cant just go in let them get start and then come back its so some people can but yeah yeah just when he runs out of work yeah so so well worry about it then th theyll certainly be time because im right next to the lab anyway ill come back just to check my email and things anyway so yeah just but h h that they no the parts built so h not not pl not planning so how h right so i wouldnt bother more than one or two certainly its right and right yeah well that thats thats just x_m_l_ so h w the real me meat of this yet to h yeah well yeah well so i dont think youll be twiddling your thbs no well at twelve oclock next monday the lab is technically booked by jules it were planning on it starts the on we this wednesday and goes through to next wednesday h what else yeah my then other complication is two weeks tomorrow i start my teaching lets see thats like the h for ive got two weeks of that fo four lectures and four labs yeah that comes at thats like the twentieth yes for the first yeah yeah monday is the yeah whats tomorrow is the f tomorrow the f first so it will be the fifteenth for two weeks my induction day so oh youve got your induction thats right cause people do ask i mean i dont its meant to be that in depth its yes yeah on a scale of one to seven yes from a total waste of time to you know usual sort of stuff you get everywhere so yeah yeah youd be surpri these things do h its probably the universityll cover itself legally i think by doing this h if they were gonna do yeah i would and i would know somebody whod gone to know you know im pretty sure they didnt have induction in my day so really no i suppose rather than being nobodys bothered so far is it well i dont remember being asked for an induction so in april can remo i got invited to a a a a suer garden party for new staff members but that was but thats all yeah i can remember before you could h u okay yeah seems reasonable i have one n_x_t_ question which hopefully wont be well its not one just hopefully as part of the output it will be something like that is that correct so youve got the gaze position of the first person gaze position of the second mouse position of the first mouse position of the second and i dont know a coon mouse action there or something does that t just in in sort of layers like that theyll yeah that yep presably yeah this is the easy stuff yes m thats thats just the the eye movement other sort of stuff yeah i mean thats just the way you want it course there are lot lots of things that can it ho hopefu hopefully thats yeah i guess its thats why i dre the hard part yeah yeah thats as well yeah h yeah so i was just yeah i was just checking that i know the language part because they say l_p_ here but this would be the the the new part new stuff yeah whatever that is oh so you dont want a pa part of this data aye but i think you i think you should yes im not sure whether we need to know exactly where they are just how many there are in each tra p i dont know i suppose it could go in i mean i suppose it were as well to have it if we can but right so its probably easier just to s shove em in you can stick em in a different track well just say stick em in anyway yeah h isnt blink a part of this h blink would at the moment just get lped in with the sort of previous gaze but but isnt that h theyre doing otherwise so it may actually the way theyre looking h to smooth h m yes h moving somewhere else or is more likely to be im thinking more that you wanna know about oh blinking at the same time as the other person was doing something i think to h yeah i was thinking more like right yes norman normally would be just as i say like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation cause youre not absorbing any new information and thats what the critical sort of deciding factor is and then you wouldnt have blinks yes so that theyll include the tier if youre gonna have it in so i i yeah would ha it would be as a separate tier where just to mark yeah so the the actual position and h w yeah whether any whats included and whats n yeah h that h no not certainly l not looking at codes no okay but h know what to look for and what not to yeah right so tha tha thats thats for the rest of the theyre already blinkcorrected i there are well theyre already identified as blinks then its i it is at th h at what stage the software that ive used p pools the blinks so will add it on im not sure what the default software that comes the eye tracker right right okay well i i if if you want if you yes yeah so im not su i certainly its listed as a separate event in the stream blinks are a tag from the e_d_f_ and and that sort of thing its registered as a a detection but so to remind me so to h just checking the times th times of the events i y yeah i mean it it it wont because of the fixation it will be down to what we define as a gaze so basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it and so if they blinked a lot within that theyre still looking at that object so its just the time in to the time out whether that h in yep for the eye tracker h wanna do it some different way h some other way yes in the in the docentation ive read through yeah but it could be these things h yep theres a blink sort of event h is what whether yep yeah it should just be a matter of treating a b adding on the blink to the last fixation or something anyway oh right yeah you said well the the real reason is as long as theyve been blinking even if they then open their eyes somewhere else thats when they start absorbing the new information its basically like a just a long saccade it you kind of have visual suppression when you move and its the same when youre blinking youre not taking anything in so okay wait okay i kinda get this yeah yeah h it its yeah that yes thats for the sort of gaze time measure its not actually the fixations are still independent so the they w fixation duration isnt doesnt include the blink in the ascii a output its only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing is it its a a sort of composite viewing time id forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object yeah yeah im afraid h looking anything and yep yep yeah yeah cause i although well also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you youve got measure fixation duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move eye fixation or not h would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else okay okay well tha tha dont dont worry well yep to ye yeah h viewing times h so i see this right yeah right yeah h well thats partly why i brought this up now is it im not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen but thats what i want out in the end right yeah well the n_x_t_ stuff will have the more complete picture cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions but therell be i suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do i s presably with g_d_f_ to before you hit before h you yeah h does is do this h h okay okay cause you you h c to n_x_t_ an oh yeah yeah the germans dont yeah yeah yeah fair enough fair en yeah so so you know oh yeah and yeah thats also why i sent you the saarbruecken software f that the stuff that takes the ascii sort of format originally and then just sort of compresses it and things yeah the german stuff because that little utility does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks whether just to lp them in or or not what the minim fixation duration for a stable fixation would be sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds you can tell it just to again lp them all together thats not a sort of reliable enough fixation you can put in these sort of of things so thats thats a bit of software thats sent and that includes the source code and things as well fair enough fair enough so h well its good starting point right so itd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do no theres very little docentation as you might imagine for these sort of things yeah so i g i yeah thats thats why so h yeah i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up h h for us to sort to h fine good looking through that and make sure that works cause yeah yeah yeah ive l yeah ive no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well so ah h cause al also just filters it there are a lot of strange event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless i think and it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk as well so it cleans it up h right right yeah well i use it that useful or no b fine well possibly and simplified yep h its yeah als well the pr pipeline you know thats yeah yeah i see what you mean the the yeah h wanna do six or it with robin so yeah so so i suppose pose that that way the well sounds good h its its not quite s it so its not gonna be quite grabbable cause it is its written in java mostly yeah gonna be the same so yeah yeah well yes the actual so h yeah fair enough well so so its so long as its x_m_l_ n_x_t_ will h yeah its always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah lossiness cause you were gonna get overload about learning eye trackers and no its just too many things at once and it wasnt important or or you leave very quickly yep yep well im i am sorry oh yeah oh dear my page is blank still find this ones mine i guess not

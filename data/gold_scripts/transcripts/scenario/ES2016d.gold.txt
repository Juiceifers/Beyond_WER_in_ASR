Yep . Soon as I
get this .
Okay . This is our last meeting .
Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line .
Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .
Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that .
Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . Then we looked at the components um
the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically
how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .
The prototype yeah . Do you need a this ?
Okay . .
but
Very nice . , where you , where you'd
Mm-hmm . , so yeah much make much difference
What but what's that button ? not do it at all Just
Uh , 'kay . on-off button .
'Kay . Right
um
Would you like to uh Right . , but
Well done .
Well luckily we are going to find out .
Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . I do .
I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . It's bright . Yeah . I would . It's Mm .
It still has your traditional black .
Yep , not angular . it .
Mm . pretty much by the company
Yep . uh to .
, definitely Yeah
Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form . Right . Right
Yeah . Yeah ?
I would say Five
four . Yeah ? Four is fair . Okay .
Very non-committal , four . .
Yeah . , 'kay
Mm-hmm . . channel and volume
S scrolling through and selecting a few . scrolling further . Yeah .
I think that's a one .
lose anymore . Yeah . It's bright Whether you want
So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could mentioned . Just just to use
And it is quite bright and what Yeah
Uh S Okay .
Yeah . , I mean a million
But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . Oh yeah Mm .
Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then . Yeah .
I'd say two .
With the speech recognition , which of course may
be changed depending on budget .
Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a so far . Yes . Yeah
it's you have . They're cheap .
Some sort of proximity technology for suitcases Yeah .
Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . Right . That'd be tough then
Yeah
Okay .
Two . . ? Two , 'kay .
It's comes down to technology . But we yeah .
But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour . right right right right . Fa But for remotes yeah .
I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . Yeah not really . 'cause it's stolen . No maybe not . But
If we added the screaming factor then we go up . Um I would say we're probably at four . Right . so many . Really
We have some spongy , yeah . that , kind of , sort Yeah as much as
No . . One would be the
Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . to fold and stuff . Yeah . Yeah .
Probably a four at most . at most .
Possibly even a five . And lastly
Y yes
If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . . More Yeah . did .
It's true . and the way you operate
Seven is .
Two point
two point four ? Is that some long division
Something . Well I haven't done math
And what what is the acceptable criteria ?
Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? Oh no
it
Alright then .
Okay . Well , let's see .
Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget .
But we do .
Okay . Yeah . Yeah
So I have here an Fifty percent Not too shabby .
Yeah .
We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well .
Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so
Well let's see . The f the Um
Wonder if I can make this
What the
Oh it won't let me do that .
Okay .
Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories . We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . Battery .
Okay so
Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery .
Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? Probably
some e either two or four .
Two ?
Like it . At four it's gonna
Excellent . They won't know until after they
This is consumerism . Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . .
'Kay , we have one of those .
'Kay then the case is a
Probably it's double curved . Double curved , yes
Case materials are plastic . Plastic .
Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . Is that right or is it just one ? N no
Maybe it's one because of the one .
'Kay . . Yeah
I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . Special colour ? Exactly , right . Oh .
Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . , but it's not special . S S That's Yeah
So we actually have the L_C_D_ display
and then is it the integrated or is it I'd say the integrated
Yeah . unfortunately
'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ? Um special form ? Special material . Mm .
. Say mahogany or so
Or titanium . They cost us all the same . Mm-hmm or titanium . remote . Yeah .
Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . just . No that's getting a bit tiny .
Um
Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five .
Which I believe is Yeah that's too much .
by three Euros over .
huh ?
So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . If it w What
Yeah 'cause the
Well 'cause we have to have both right ? Yeah
Mm-hmm . . So
So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? Uh
Well there we go . Twelve point five . . Perfect . There we go . Perfect .
Okay .
So we just remove our
screen here . . Make it a bigger
.
Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote .
Back to the design room boys . So
. .
Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um Yeah .
So
I guess that
Let's see here .
I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But
I'd like to hear your thoughts .
Fair enough Trying to fill in some time there
Uh h what did you think of our project process ? .
. yeah I think we did
Good . Good teamwork
Yeah I think We sort of knew where
we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . Um um straight away I thought .
But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .
Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I
think we tried a lotta different things and um
I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .
Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ?
Which was the whiteboard and the pens . Yeah . We've used the whiteboard .
I had some problem with the pen I think , but minus your p Well that's not my Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
Well that work yeah
just you
Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired . Heads are gonna roll , believe me .
Okay . N new ideas found ? Um
Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for
technology . .
Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated .
Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it .
And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting .
Actually .
Um so there will probably be another
questionnaire coming up .
And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . But that's the end of our meeting . . a while though .
Can try to plug that in there but There is our remo
Right . That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might anything you want to add ?
Mm-hmm . uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . Exactly , use both . Might as well think about Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . T the actual thing might be
Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one one on either side or . Yeah .
what's that button ? Uh , 'kay . not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button . That's um Just the on and off .
yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .
. Right ? Um that's not um I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there . There you go . Yeah . It's you
to uh Right .
. Um
?
Yep , not angular . angles to it .
I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . However the colour , we don't have a say in that . Yeah I think the colours detract a little
Mm . Yep . That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . But say it . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . . That's true . Yeah .
a a modern Right .
Right . It's different . You don't want your uh
three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .
Yeah .
What do you think
. Very non-committal Yeah . is fair . Okay .
It's very intuitive , I think yeah .
S give it a one . aim , one of the main aims that we had . One
Mm-hmm Right . , which are channel
. Right . .
So that's a one . one ? Yeah
Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . Yeah complaints . Whether
. Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , you're not gonna lose it .
Oops . don't think you'd
Hmm . it's not gonna fall
And it is quite bright Well what
Uh S Okay .
Mm . true .
I think . Probably two Oh yeah . You probably Yeah .
Mm .
With the
Y you could add an extra feature actually .
Which makes this thing
raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .
Which , which may We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .
were just a Yes .
It's it's key rings you have . They're cheap ? Yeah .
Some sort of proximity Um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much . expensive . Yeah .
So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other stick it on the T_V_ .
. Right . That'd be tough then . Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .
Okay . Let's add one of those features and say yes . ? gonna say okay . So we're back to a one
Two . Two . . ? Two , 'kay .
Uh
so
It's all just remote controls
It's But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right . Yeah it's stolen technology . But we have . Fa From iPod yeah . But for remotes yeah .
you the truth . Yeah not really . not . But
If we added ? Not so many
. Um Right .
We have some spongy , yeah . Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . Yeah as much as
No . It's not a one though . One would be the whole thing
got what to fold and stuff .
the bottom Yeah .
Probably a four So that's a four at most .
If your fashion Y yes . More Yeah . I'd say we did
, you betcha Yeah
It's true . Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is On the Yeah . Be what we
.
two
I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . No I can't do long very impressive . It's been a while .
pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate
So I have here an Yeah . We want a fifty percent Fifty percent , you're kidding . P Not too shabby .
It's too much .
let's see Um
Uh
. I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses
four Battery .
Two Two .
. At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month .
Excellent . They won't know until after they bought it .
This is consumerism
, sample sensor
That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . ?
double curved . Double curved , yes .
plastic Plastic .
. Is that right or is it just one ? Maybe it's one because N no . No that's just one .
'Kay It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . Yeah
, which is nice . Special Exactly , right . Oh .
That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . Bright yellow .
, integrated scroll-wheel S
Yeah . Yes unfortunately . .
We could of course make the buttons wood . Say mahogany or so
Or titanium . They cost us all Mm-hmm or titanium . . Yeah .
Well we only have Uh just .
really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the No that's getting a bit tiny
is Yeah that's too much .
It's hard to believe .
So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ?
took out the the one single button we've got
Mm-hmm . I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . So s yeah let's take away the Yeah . Yeah you could maybe take
Yeah . Yeah . display even , if it if it
So Right .
Right . We may not need it .
Well there we go There you go . Perfect . There we go
screen Screen
. Easier to use
Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . Back to the design Okay , the
So we can just
take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . .
central ? Oh that's just yeah . That was just we ran out of yellow What's the blue part ? Oh that's the batteries . Okay
There you go . Oops . There you go . Even
There you go . One more criteria . all those fruit lovers out there .
Uh Fair enough . Trying to fill in some time there .
Great . I think we did yeah I think we
Yeah .
Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go . Yeah . Right .
I Super super .
minus your p Well Well that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know fiasco . No I know . I'm yeah . Incom
Have a we have a list of employees Heads are gonna roll , believe me .
Yes yes .
we'll have to check with the though
The prototype The prototype discussion .
Okay No .
Can try to plug that in there but There is our remo the banana . Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic .
Very nice . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .
And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam .
Right . That's That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ?
Mm-hmm . it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . Exactly Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .
think about Th think about the button as well . Like either T the actual thing might be smaller . Yeah .
? Uh . It's a quick on-off Just the on and off .
. You Yeah .
Would you like to go . Right It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , but
And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ .
I think it's .
else out there Yeah .
I would say , I would I would .
. It's bright . It's
It's curved . It's not there's no sharp
Yep angles to it .
That has been , that has Some people might say it . Yeah . bit .
Yeah .
with Yeah .
. Yeah . ?
S Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .
Mm-hmm . S scrolling through and selecting a few Right . Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . Yeah . I'd say that
So if we don't lose anymore . Yeah . It's bright yellow . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned . Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .
it could Oops . Hmm . Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to
and Yeah . Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?
Yeah . Mm I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . That's true
. Probably . You probably Yeah .
gonna be lost then Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah .
It's it's Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . So it can't be that Annoying alarm or something ? Yeah .
based on this anti expensive .
of proximity technology Yeah .
. Yeah .
somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and stick it on the T_V_ .
Right
Yeah .
Two Two Two . ? Two
It's all just I'd say so . Uh don't get many mo remote controls with
screens on .
It's technology when it comes down to Yeah it's stolen technology . But we have . From iPod yeah .
. Course that wasn't right Fa
I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth Yeah 'cause it's stolen . No maybe not .
? Not
, yeah . , kind of , sort of . Yeah as much as as needed , I think .
on the back . Yeah .
Yeah . I'd say
, you betcha . Yeah .
the in the L_C_D_ On the
the form Yeah .
Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely .
Seven
? Is that some long division ? No .
Just , I'm sure there's a . Okay we'll say two point four
No I can't do long very impressive . It's been a while
. Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . Oh
Two point four two basically . .
. Charge about three hundred quid for it .
probably take ? Probably
That's the We're advanced chip are we ?
. . Yeah yeah . Right
, but it's not special .
pushbutton S
, and an L_C_D_ That's
Yeah .
And then
or is it Yes I'd say the integrated .
Mm .
all the same . Well we only have . Uh just remote control .
, we shouldn't be charged anything No that's getting a bit
the tiny .
Yeah . I'd ignore that .
a banana-shaped If it w
What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .
Yeah .
on the television Yeah .
away the Yeah . Yeah . Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself .
? Uh that is possible yeah .
. Twelve . There we go .
screen here . Screen . Make it a bigger dial . Easier to use . Even easier to use then .
does
central ? Oh that's just yeah . That was just we ran out of yellow . ? Oh that's the batteries . Okay
you go . Oops . There you go . Even simpler .
There you go . One more criteria . Yeah . For all those fruit lovers out there .
. Now it's yes Yeah .
Good . Great . Yeah . I think we did yeah I think we did quite well . Um Good teamwork
. There you go . Yeah . Right from the start of the day . .
I think we st We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .
was the whiteboard and the pens . Super Yeah . We've used the whiteboard .
they've just
a list of employees .
. Yes
technology Technology used .
Excellent .
plug that in there but remo the banana
but it would be held
button . That's um
It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out
Pretty impressive .
Kind of a banana .
. Um do you have a marketing presentation I do .
Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .
Um .
Okay .
So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .
Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .
And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that .
Okay .
So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?
definitely different Mm .
I would say , I would I would .
Mm .
, when
, we don't have a say in that . That has Some people might say Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit .
That's true .
with the ugly remote Yeah .
Um okay so , do you think , since we
Yeah Yeah . This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? Does that sound good ?
What do you think ? Three ? Four ?
I would say four . Yeah Five ? Four is fair . Okay .
Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?
Yeah . . One , 'kay .
Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?
. 'Cause we've we've I'd say that
I think that's a one . So that's a one . So one ? Yeah ?
Okay .
Something that big Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .
don't lose anymore . Yeah . It's bright yellow . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .
Yeah
Uh S Okay .
Mm . it . That's true .
do go with the Mm .
With
It's it's . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have Annoying alarm or something ? Yeah .
Right
So . Are we adding one of these
Let's add one of those features and say yes two features ? gonna say okay .
Two . . Two . Two . So we're back to a one ? Or a two ? Two , 'kay .
Okay . Are we technologically innovative ?
It's technology when it comes down to Yeah it's stolen technology . But we From iPod yeah .
But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow right But for remotes yeah .
Two ? Three ?
If we added the screaming But how many remotes do you see like this ? Not so many .
Really ? Okay . That's gonna hurt us . Okay . Um spongy material ?
'Kay .
Possibly even a five . And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?
If your fashion . More Yeah . I'd say we did .
, you betcha Yeah
. 'Kay .
Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen .
Seventeen divided by s
is Eight .
Something . Well I haven't done math in years .
Just What two I dunno .
. Okay we'll say two point four two .
Right ?
How does that look ?
. No I can't do long very impressive . It's been a while .
to hit ? Oh no . They just told me to
pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically .
So that's that .
.
on . Two Oh my god . Okay .
Yeah we'll go with that .
So I have here Not too shabby .
Excellent . They won't know until after they bought
I yeah . Right .
nice , right Oh .
. It's a specially ugly Bright yellow .
, but it's not special .
the
. Say
Or titanium . They cost us all Mm-hmm or titanium . It'd look really lovely . Yeah .
only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't . No
Yeah
Okay Leave it blank .
?
. What if we completely
'cause the
. Twelve point five . go . Perfect .
screen here . Make it a
Besides
does to our lovely remote . Okay
. So
central ? Oh that's just yeah . That was just we ran out of yellow . What's the blue part ? Oh that's the batteries . Okay .
simpler .
Looks more like a banana .
more criteria . out there .
. Next
Fair enough Trying to fill in some time there .
Good . Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go . Yeah Good teamwork .
, but minus your Well Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
Well obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know No I know . I'm yeah . Incom
we have a list of employees that you would like fired . , believe me . Yes yes .
Mm . Kinda .
the last meeting
And then we'll have to check with the . We might have a while though .

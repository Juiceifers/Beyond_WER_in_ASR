oh okay thanks for coming to this meeting s how we doing on our remote we have some we have some ideas and some hm ideas for what people want yeah alright let us just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting see if i cannot get things moving along here a little bit better i will go over what we went over last time which should not take long i think then i believe each of you have a presentation i have was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote what they want then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do and how it is going to do it hopefully and then we will have the closing which we will have forty minutes for let us see the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what i am responsible for leading the meetings keeping the notes and coming up with the final presentation corinne is our marketing expert she is going to figure out what what the conser wants ryan is our user interface designer and manuel is the industrial designer so you are going to come up with the ideas ryan and you are going to pick em apart we decided our remote we want it to be a universal remote that everyone would want we want to be modern fun different it needs to be sturdy easy to find so we going to have that locator function and we want to be different and then we went over a couple of different ideas ballshaped phone the keyboard shape we decided that it should probably be onehanded something we could use with one hand and that was our last meeting so why do not do each of you have a presentation yep okay i will hand it off to you and does anyone do you wanna go first so we can maybe see what what the people want sure to go to the next one yeah you click on that guy yeah oh right right right that one okay i actually hit f_ eight again i think yeah you want it to be on both screens or just just yours no i want something else on mine yeah but i think you have to hit escape and then you can yeah okay oh hit f_ eight again i know i did the same thing and then it should come up here shortly kay i think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen i am not sure you could maybe minimise that screen and then and have something yeah yeah oh well have them both up at the same time i think yeah it is okay kay very nice now we actually have some ideas of what what people want what we should focus on wait can i look at that real quick oh yeah what was your last conclusion on that one focus on the i on something the image of it the f kay good good accomplish it so so we could the the the more complex we make it of course the more expensive to the industrial design department expensive it is going to be but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote so h possibly it might be worth the investment i agree well and you need to sort of take i myself i find when you h when there is something like spee speech recognition like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end and you say one for this and you find yours like you said saying the same thing over and over and over yeah i find myself especially if i am in a crowd of people looking really silly so maybe if you are sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then yeah you know you wou i do not know if would would you want to keep saying vole up vole down change the channel you know channel up channel down i i do not know yeah h for yeah it is a it is a giick factor that they like at first and i do not think it is yeah okay let us see here do you wanna put your yeah i guess so oh right in trade you go now i was sent a couple of things to modify our new requirements the remote is only going to be for the television which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that not only is a universal remote more complicated it is more cost more costly and your re research showed that you know most of the people do not even use it i think you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem no teletext so we do not have to worry about that but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan which is we put the fashion in electronics and our corporate colours are grey and yellow and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three the three new requirements that that i was told we need to use from all all three of your presentations i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting we want something that looks good we want something that is simple we want something that you can find easily and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of give or take it is going to cost more s the young the younger people say that they like it but it is h probably i would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition and that way we can focus on our form that would be that would be good if we were going with our our ball or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good you know that could be the charger for you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote and that would be or solar or you know however however you wanted to go about it the holder could also be the charging unit could sit on a yeah yeah with the locator button and if it were the ball you would no longer have to have a flat space on it like if we still have the how to hold on to it and well you still do you s you still it is going to roll away watching it is going to roll off so rolls away yeah so i guess after the meeting we will have some questionnaires and and some smaries for for what is going on then we will take lunch then we can come back and work on our individual work i will do the minutes let us see it looks like you are already on your way for working with the components chips the what chips we need and what you know how to power it and whatnot user interface concept we want it to be something simple minimal nber of buttons i guess our i guess our main main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look you know did you have time earlier to to work on that did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done not really kay i th i i do h so that shall we maybe shoot for a a specific target group that way we could l i mean if it were if we were shooting for young guys then it is a certain look to the remote or girls or older people would that you think that would help us find a specific form that we would would wanna pick out some info on that kay so we know that the remote is going to have to be we will just say we have got a colour scheme for it yellow and you know yellow it is nice and bright with the buttons being grey or black and our slogan pasted somewhere on it on the the bottom or the you know yeah bottom perhaps yeah maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort you know maybe we could flare it or something you know so it is more of course this will look like a bone then go ahead and erase this hope everyone memorised that you i mean it might be yeah yeah been going they have gone from yeah everybody is got a mobile phone right except for me now but they are all you know mobile phones they have kind of taken a turn to where they are really small which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time but then again you do not want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in right yeah so we have got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we are what we are stuck with maybe we could go with a square or something you know with minimal nber of buttons i guess you have got you know one through nine for typing in your channels you have got vole up and down channel up and down power usually at the top a mute that is that is pretty much all you need i think design a menu button maybe so you know if you if we want the remote to do other things like or i guess the t_v_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into t_v_s we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in press the menu button scroll up and down to select it kay so it is talk about maybe h this yeah like a wheel on your mouse so yeah sort of that you can s a good idea also when it comes h look g yeah looks good what i am getting at here fel look at it from h to the thb yeah to the side right to the thb yeah yeah is everyone who in here is righthanded lefthanded you guys all righthanded yeah so i am lefthanded but i so i can say that most things are designed for righthanded people right so righthanded yeah right h like the written language or english maybe you could buy like maybe ow i would say i mean it should be probably designed for a righthanded p person special order yeah but that is that is good that is w i think we have got a kind of a good plan there at least for what buttons we are going to use so we have got i like the scroll the scroll action and the i mean i am just yeah kinda like holding a on any hand if you just had yeah maybe could be good so two remotes in one but then would be easier to lose one or the other that is it actually is your coffee table make it a piece of furniture yes yeah okay well we need to finish up here so for the next so for the next before the next meeting w sh shall we work on you are watching trends to see what what kind of new information we have got going on yep h manuel you are going to work on the components for for what we are going to use let us go with our our rounded right kind of fit in your hand let us explore the the possibility of having the twopiece so one for the the quick zapping and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand alright yeah and ryan you work on how how well they will work with the us with the user so both of those concepts how well it will work yeah and okay i think we made some good progress here see you in alright i dunno i gu i guess we will take lunch in about half an hour or i guess we will be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we will probably have another meeting okay what the people want eight f_ eight f_ eight was just jus yeah is it j just just just using it yeah does that just mean like changing the channel okay cable there thank you okay going to talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there right so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it so i am going to do a lot of the stuff on the board just this is the basic basic premise of a remote control the basic function is to send messages to another system okay so much is clear an energy source feeds an integrated circuit like a chip that can compose messages often in the form of infrared bits this is the most mostly used there is also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system parts are cheaper as well a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages this is where my people screwed up basically so i am going to explain that on the board rather what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there we will start with an energy source right which is usually a battery right since it is not feasible to add a cable to that this energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself which can be buttons whatever which in fact controls a chip right this is the user interface and there we have the chip the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp that sends out the signal of course the signal differs accordingly depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp and of course that is controlled the chip itself is controlled by the user interface the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well so that you know that it is working basically you press something you get a response which is also comparatively important on one of those devices now this what we are talking about here or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly the the energy source for one thing can be altered what we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared the sending device basically the infrared lamp we cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp right these two are components that we have to use and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing the lamp can be put onto the desi the device it c it does not have to be there this can be discussed as well the user interface that is something we can also discuss as we have heard speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment speech recognition interface we do not know that or if we just do the usual button thing or we have a touch pad or something like that that is something we can discuss and of course the energy source batteries solar cells who knows of course it is always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough developed enough but that is like i s i suppose rather up to marketing and not to the the the more complex to the industrial design department expensive expensive it is going to be get yeah possibly right i guess so oh right now i was sent go s the young the h like if we still have the how to hold well you still do you s you still it is going to roll away w yeah you put it on t on the couch table while you are watching it is going to roll off so that is not an issue really rolls away yeah we need and what right that is with the buttons being all you know mobile right hm that is that is that is the classical design right yeah talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad it is h like a wheel on your mouse talk about maybe f look at that from the side there maybe which is technically the easiest option would probably be like a scrolling little scrolling wheel like this yeah yeah yeah so sort of yeah sort of like that you can even if we are coming from mice we can even add a click function where you in order to verify the information you just press it down s a good idea right also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing if you wanna make it square for the looks of it then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing you add a little bulge down here just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on look g yeah looks good i know you know what i am getting at here fel look at it from the side it is like that right h to the thb yeah then you hold it in your hand like this and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side right yes s to the thb yeah right you can also have it maybe talking about mobile phones again sliding open with the lesser used functions on this part and then it slides into that part and out behind definitely just like o well i was just thinking this this of course causes your hand yeah right on the and your causes a problem for left or righthanded people actually so yeah that is also true right you guys all righthanded right righthanded i so like the that is right or right that minimises it sizewise as well minimise its size it could be small then there is maybe another point of making it a twoinone kind of thing if we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one you give it the full functions in here and just a couple of functions in there like your zap zapping device is just u channels updown vole and onoff that is it yeah zapping functions h yeah maybe be good that is right means the big one has to be sufficiently big and perhaps heavy so you cannot move it around it actually is your coffee table make it a piece of furniture yes yes there you go yeah yeah or a statue or something for for what right the quick zapping alright see alright alright yeah du we have yeah we yes s i have lo i have done the role that i was asked to do anyway i think to go to slide show just press the arrow keys i think usually goes to it okay sorry just jus yeah is is it j just just just using it yeah zap does that just mean like changing the channel okay a repetitive strain injury just repetitive strain injury i think that is what i guess okay okay yeah that you needed kay having just listened to what corinne just said i will draw on some of the things as well some things that sort of relevant to what i wanna say kay so i am just going to yeah approach the technical functions design the method i used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change prograe and operate an electronic device remotely i mean that is an obvious thing to say but it is not attached to the device that you want to control i had some things sent to me not very much to look at similar devices defined in some them and then the personal preferences that i will suggest we discussed a universal one like it is just been brought up again then but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it because you would need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies i am not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself but you have to i they are a nightmare to use you have to set them reset them to everything and that would only add buttons whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons so i think it would be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t_v_s or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications if if the aim is to get something that is unique in design okay here here is just two pictures of remote controls they are just simple t_v_ remote controls but one is usercentred that is the one on the left and you can straight away see there is less buttons and the other one is engineercentred where that is more specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it is trying to control which appeals more to the product that we want and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be usercentred fewer buttons simpler to use and if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what is used maybe the other fifty percent the buttons that are used very rarely like prograing they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they are hidden away and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across and finally sort i have sort of covered that our product i think should be user interface orientated like i said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control a universal remote might be too complex and as what it the major findings market researchers have said it is the image and the appearance that people di dislike so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend and then and change the fashion of remote controls and that is it the i the image of it kay on something on the image of it the f the actual design i think speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it is on your phone yeah well and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well recognition on the other end and yeah yeah you know you vole and wou i do not know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff if you were watching something would you sort of be wanting down yeah i think themselves a fifteen h it is a it is as well it would be j the giick factor for the younger people but practically i do not think it is know yeah and yeah it will wear off gets do you wanna put your cord back in i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster whatever you wanna call it that you you should put it back in your remote but if you do not put it back in you press something like a little button on that and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something just by infrared that should not be too complex i would have thought or or with you yeah it would be quite good the ball could sit on a for you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i will yeah i will have a look try look at the actual appearance in the next break kay h i th i i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately onehanded the ball is probably not a good idea and even something that is held like that might be difficult so that i think it still has to be a variation on maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring as plain as a rectangle d i do not know if that might cope with like the trendwatching i find anything more on that it yeah bottom or the you know bottom perhaps yeah yeah yeah you i mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones and the shapes that the they have been going they have gone from big brick block things which is a remote control is to sort of slinky small things now yeah carry it around in maybe you bring the buttons yes s yeah right to the thb yeah maybe the buttons could like decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important the smaller here with the yeah on this part and then it slides behind definitely and out just like o on a sort of side view something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better so you know you just sort of have your hand this of course causes causes yeah right on the and your thb would be up here type thing so yeah that is also true right instantly sort of always going for the righthanded person yeah but i mean the older so all righthanded yeah so right righthanded yeah i mean i am just just thinking maybe if it was circular with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had with the way that was more like that whereas this is just a onehanded thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thb so you would have your you would put your hand into there with the thb there yeah kinda like holding a and then your thb would do you would have all the buttons sort of round here and that i think could work on any hand if you just had it like wrapped round there left or right it sizewise as well minimise its size it could be you know really quite small there like yeah h zapping device is zapping functions make it a piece of furniture yeah yes yes there you go yeah see what what kind yep part that fits yeah with the us with the user how well it will work yeah see alright alright yeah thanks for coming to this meeting hm i think yep so sure what was it function f_ eight f_ eight well how do i get it to the next one yeah oh right right right that guy yeah that one okay alright well this is my report which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that i was sent oh gosh i have no idea g goes to it okay sorry i actually need to see something else on my screen yeah and then again or just just yours no i want something else on mine is that possible oh okay but now you do not have that i know i sorry guys i think so is there no way i can give you the slideshow and give us the slideshow and something on your screen have something yeah yeah oh well have them both yeah time i think it is okay okay so first of all the method that i used was by doing some marketing research by doing research on some interviews that were conducted and then some internet research and i was sent a report that was i think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed and so i will show you some of the results from that which i think will be helpful okay here are some of the findings they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly which is a fairly significant nber i would say and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy so i think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look i think that is definitely important just jus yeah is is it j just just just using it yeah they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot and if anyone could clarify what that means zap does that just mean like changing the channel okay and fifty percent of the users say that they are only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control and there was something else they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons and some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all of course channel selection is used the most frequently and then teletext was the next vole and then power and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used so i think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button the biggest user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere and so i think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i_ a repetitive just repetitive what is it that is what i guess okay okay and so bas okay as far as speech recognition goes the younger group looks like they are all for it from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more and it kind of just went down incrementally the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it is worth investing in this at least if we are targeting the younger groups and so in conclusion some things that i drew from this are that i think we were correct we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room we need to simplify the remote and reduce the nber of buttons get rid of the ones that do not seem to be serving much purpose and then lastly i thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition and that is it oh yeah yeah sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed kay the to actually accomplish it so i am remote h and o if it is on your phone yeah yeah i think as another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they would do it but probably a lot of them that is actually their parents money like i do not know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves a fifteen year old you know for the younger people yeah gets old yeah think you i guess with any form that it is going to roll away while you are watching it is going to roll off so rolls away yeah meetings to get everything done that you need to get done not really the ball is probably as plain as i find anything yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we will have some info on that on it on the yeah being able to this big and you had a handbag power yeah yeah the side looks good fel look at h you guys all righthanded right right but h maybe ow maybe you could buy like a special lefthanded version of the remote special order yeah like your h yeah maybe could be good it actually is your coffee table make it a piece of furniture yes yes there you go yeah yeah to see what what yep h and then

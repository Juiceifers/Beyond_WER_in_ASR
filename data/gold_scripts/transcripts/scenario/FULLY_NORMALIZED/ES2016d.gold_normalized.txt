yep soon as i get this okay this is our last meeting i will go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting and then we will have a the prototype presentation then we will do an evaluation or we will see what what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation then we will go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget then we will do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we will need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line let us see minutes from the last meeting we looked at the the trends we had the fashion trends that people want a fancy lookandfeel it was twice as important as anything else they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype they wanted limited buttons and simplicity then we looked at the the method for coming up with our own remote looking at other other devices the ipod we really liked the look of that we also had the kid is remote for a simple idea a two part remote which was what were were originally looking at and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use but i think we have still decided not to go with that then we looked at the components the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote and basically how what were making for the prototype so i am going to leave it at that and let you guys take over the prototype yeah do you need a this okay but very nice where you where you would h so yeah much make much difference what but what is that button not do it at all just kay onoff button kay right would you like to right but well done well luckily we are going to find out or not luckily do you have a marketing presentation for us i do i think it is definitely different than anything else out there so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say i would say most definitely it is bright yeah i would it is it still has your traditional black yep not angular it pretty much by the company yep to definitely yeah yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form right right yeah yeah i would say five four yeah four is fair okay very noncoittal four yeah kay h channel and vole s scrolling through and selecting a few scrolling further yeah i think that is a one lose anymore yeah it is bright whether you want so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could mentioned just just to use and it is quite bright and what yeah s okay yeah i mean a million but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it then our scale goes up quite a bit i think oh yeah probably two you know if we eliminate the fact that you know it is impossible to guarantee that it is not going to be lost then yeah i would say two with the speech recognition which of course may be changed depending on budget which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a so far yes yeah it is you have they are cheap some sort of proximity technology for suitcases yeah pray that you do not accidentally lose that piece right that would be tough then yeah okay two two kay it is comes down to technology but we yeah but there is not a lot of yellow there is not a lotta yellow course that was not really we were kinda forced to take that colour right right right right fa but for remotes yeah i do not know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth yeah not really cause it is stolen no maybe not but if we added the screaming factor then we go up i would say we are probably at four right so many really we have some spongy yeah that kind of sort yeah as much as no one would be the yeah because it is only got what these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back to fold and stuff yeah yeah probably a four at most at most possibly even a five and lastly y yes if your fashion is b is carmen miranda you betcha more yeah did it is true and the way you operate seven is two point two point four is that some long division something well i have not done math and what what is the acceptable criteria is there like a scale that we have to hit oh no it alright then okay well let us see now we get to do the budget nbers you did not know that you were going to have a budget but we do okay yeah yeah so i have here an fifty percent not too shabby yeah we want a fifty percent profit on this oh you cannot really see that very well twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us okay so well let us see the f the wonder if i can make this what the oh it will not let me do that okay alright so at top i do not know if you guys can read that or not i cannot cause i do not have my glasses on but so we have got the energy source there is four five six categories we have energy source electronics case then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements battery okay so first of all energy source we picked battery and how many batteries do we think this will probably take probably some e either two or four two like it at four it is going to excellent they will not know until after they this is conserism alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chiponprint regular chiponprint advanced chiponprint sample sensor sample speaker kay we have one of those kay then the case is a probably it is double curved double curved yes case materials are plastic plastic i guess it is two since one for the top one for the bottom is that right or is it just one n no maybe it is one because of the one kay yeah i guess it does not matter cause the price on that one is zero which is nice special colour exactly right oh interface type we have pushbutton scrollwheel interface integrated scrollwheel pushbutton and an l_c_d_ display but it is not special s s that is yeah so we actually have the l_c_d_ display and then is it the integrated or is it i would say the integrated yeah unfortunately kay button supplement special colour special form special material say mahogany or so or titani they cost us all the same h or titani remote yeah well we only have one button so really we should not be charged we should not be charged anything for the the button supplements just no that is getting a bit tiny okay we are going to leave that one blank because we run on a l_c_d_ and scroll so our total is fifteen point five which i believe is yeah that is too much by three euros over h so the only thing better than a bananashaped remote is one that you shake if it w what yeah cause the well cause we have to have both right yeah h so so we may not need the l_c_d_ display well there we go twelve point five perfect there we go perfect okay so we just remove our screen here make it a bigger besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote back to the design room boys so okay so the costs under twelve point five euro was no we redesigned it now it is yes next slide project evaluation project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found yeah so i guess that let us see here i think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me but i would like to hear your thoughts fair enough trying to fill in some time there h what did you think of our project process yeah i think we did good good teamwork yeah i think we sort of knew where we st we started off a little little weak our leadership was quite weak in the beginning straight away i thought but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing room for creativity there was that i think we tried a lotta different things and i think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things you guys worked together well as a team and the means which was the whiteboard and the pens yeah we have used the whiteboard i had some problem with the pen i think but minus your p well that is not my minus your powerpoint fiasco well that work yeah just you have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired heads are going to roll believe me okay n new ideas found yes for the remote maybe no not f for technology alright closing costs are within the budget project is evaluated complete the final questionnaire and meeting smary that is it and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting actually so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up and then we will have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that but that is the end of our meeting a while though can try to plug that in there but there is our remo right that is what we have there that is plastic plastic covered with rubber we might anything you want to add h add some more underneath here maybe give it give it a form i mean you are supposed to hold it like that but just if you grab it take it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah exactly use both might as well think about yeah does not make much make much difference you could work lefthanded or righthanded i suppose t the actual thing might be th think about the button as well like either put either one one on either side or yeah what is that button kay not do it at all it is a quick onoff button that is just the on and off yeah i think it is pretty important so you do not have to fiddle with that right that is not i would say a bit smaller would probably be nice you wanna play with that over there there you go yeah it is you to right yep not angular angles to it i would say when it comes to the ergonomics the form and stuff yes that is definitely more beautiful than your average however the colour we do not have a say in that yeah i think the colours detract a little yep that has been that has been dictated pretty much by the company so to answer that honestly i would rather say like we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly definitely s nothing you can say about that i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form but say it yeah yeah yeah that is true yeah a a modern right right it is different you do not want your three feet huge l_c_d_ dis display in your living room that is hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that yeah what do you think very noncoittal yeah is fair okay it is very intuitive i think yeah s give it a one aim one of the main aims that we had one h right which are channel right so that is a one one yeah something that big and that yellow you just do not lose anymore yeah complaints whether bright yellow is hard to lose but if we were to you are not going to lose it oops do not think you would h it is not going to fall and it is quite bright well what s okay true i think probably two oh yeah you probably yeah with the y you could add an extra feature actually which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television which which may we could add that but that is nothing we have thought of so far were just a yes it is it is key rings you have they are cheap yeah some sort of proximity the it is based on this anti antitheft technology for suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that is attached to your luggage another piece that starts beeping that cannot cost much expensive yeah so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other stick it on the t_v_ right that would be tough then well also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole you t your television yeah ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control okay let us add one of those features and say yes going to say okay so we are back to a one two two two kay so it is all just remote controls it is but there is not a lot of yellow there is not a lotta yellow course that was not really we were kinda forced to take it is all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right yeah it is stolen technology but we have fa from ipod yeah but for remotes yeah you the truth yeah not really not but if we added not so many right we have some spongy yeah yeah well you have that kind of sort of yeah as much as no it is not a one though one would be the whole thing got what to fold and stuff the bottom yeah probably a four so that is a four at most if your fashion y yes more yeah i would say we did you betcha yeah it is true well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l_c_d_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour but it definitely is on the yeah be what we two i am impressed i cannot do that without a calculator no i cannot do long very impressive it is been a while pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate so i have here an yeah we want a fifty percent fifty percent you are kidding p not too shabby it is too much let us see i cannot cause i do not have my glasses four battery two two at four it is going to be too heavy so that that is not our problem people can change it every month excellent they will not know until after they bought it this is conserism sample sensor that is the advanced chiponprint yeah double curved double curved yes plastic plastic is that right or is it just one maybe it is one because n no no that is just one kay it is just one mo single mould we can do that yeah which is nice special exactly right oh that is not a special colour it is a specially ugly colour but it is not special bright yellow integrated scrollwheel s yeah yes unfortunately we could of course make the buttons wood say mahogany or so or titani they cost us all h or titani yeah well we only have just really we should not be charged we should not be charged anything for the no that is getting a bit tiny is yeah that is too much it is hard to believe so we will go for the hand dynamo h took out the the one single button we have got h i mean let us let us face it it also depends on the software on the on the television you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen so s yeah let us take away the yeah yeah you could maybe take yeah yeah display even if it if it so right right we may not need it well there we go there you go perfect there we go screen screen easier to use besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote back to the design okay the so we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go central oh that is just yeah that was just we ran out of yellow what is the blue part oh that is the batteries okay there you go oops there you go even there you go one more criteria all those fruit lovers out there fair enough trying to fill in some time there great i think we did yeah i think we yeah just half a day you have a remote there you go yeah right i super super minus your p well well that is not my fault that is obviously the people i work for that work for me they have just you know fiasco no i know i am yeah incom have a we have a list of employees heads are going to roll believe me yes yes we will have to check with the though the prototype the prototype discussion okay no can try to plug that in there but there is our remo the banana yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned it is basically designed around a banana but it would be held in such a fashion where it is obviously it would not be that floppy cause this would be hard plastic very nice these would be like the rubber the rubber grips so that is so that would hopefully help with grip or like the ergonomics of it but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel you have to use your imagination a little bit and this here represents the screen where you where you would go through and the the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod where that one way ch through channels that way th other way through channels vole up and down and then to access the more complicated functions you would you sorta go you press that and go through the menus it is that that simple that just represents the infrared beam right that is that is a simple on and off switch i do not know we could use the voice t that blue bits should be yellow d that that would be where the batteries would be i suppose and that is about it it is as simple as you we could make it really is there anything you want to add h it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah exactly yeah does not make much make much difference you could work lefthanded or righthanded i suppose think about th think about the button as well like either t the actual thing might be smaller yeah it is a quick onoff just the on and off you yeah would you like to go right it is you know it is flimsy cause it is made out of heavy playdoh but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose with the scroll and the l_c_d_ i think it is else out there yeah i would say i would i would it is bright it is it is curved it is not there is no sharp yep angles to it that has been that has some people might say it yeah bit yeah with yeah yeah s yeah i think that was the main aim one of the main aims that we had h s scrolling through and selecting a few right yeah cause we have we have brought it down to basically four controls most coon which are channel and vole and then the other ones are just a matter of just going just scrolling further yeah i would say that so if we do not lose anymore yeah it is bright yellow bright yellow is hard to lose but if we were to if we were that the speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing that was what we would we would mentioned whether you want to or not you are not going to lose it it could oops h just just to use to find it when it was lost but like i said like i do not think you would lose something so yellow so easily and it is not going to fall like a rectangle would slip down behind things that is going to be a difficult shape to and yeah maybe in the middle again three or four or something yeah i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose i mean a million ways you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you have lost it that is true probably you probably yeah going to be lost then yeah yeah yeah it is it is yeah true but i mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have they are cheap so it cannot be that annoying alarm or something yeah based on this anti expensive of proximity technology yeah yeah somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and stick it on the t_v_ right yeah two two two two it is all just i would say so do not get many mo remote controls with screens on it is technology when it comes down to yeah it is stolen technology but we have from ipod yeah course that was not right fa i do not know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth yeah cause it is stolen no maybe not not yeah kind of sort of yeah as much as as needed i think on the back yeah yeah i would say you betcha yeah the in the l_c_d_ on the the form yeah be what we were told and they would say yeah definitely seven is that some long division no just i am sure there is a okay we will say two point four no i cannot do long very impressive it is been a while yeah yeah so you would been going a long time dividing that it is two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on oh two point four two basically charge about three hundred quid for it probably take probably that is the we are advanced chip are we yeah yeah right but it is not special pushbutton s and an l_c_d_ that is yeah and then or is it yes i would say the integrated all the same well we only have just remote control we should not be charged anything no that is getting a bit the tiny yeah i would ignore that a bananashaped if it w what if we completely took out the the one single button we have got on and just had a scroll wheel interface and the l_c_d_ display i suppose the l_c_d_ c_ display is the one that is pushing it up a bit though yeah on the television yeah away the yeah yeah yeah you could maybe take out the l_c_d_ dis display even if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself that is possible yeah twelve there we go screen here screen make it a bigger dial easier to use even easier to use then does central oh that is just yeah that was just we ran out of yellow oh that is the batteries okay you go oops there you go even simpler there you go one more criteria yeah for all those fruit lovers out there now it is yes yeah good great yeah i think we did yeah i think we did quite well good teamwork there you go yeah right from the start of the day i think we st we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought was the whiteboard and the pens super yeah we have used the whiteboard they have just a list of employees yes technology technology used excellent plug that in there but remo the banana but it would be held button that is it is you know it is flimsy cause it is made out pretty impressive kind of a banana do you have a marketing presentation i do okay you guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria okay so first i will just discuss some of the criteria that i found just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier and then we will do a group evaluation of the prototype and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did so the criteria we are going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier so we are going to be doing it based on a seven point scale and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that with seven being false we did not achieve that okay so for the first one we need to decide did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote definitely different i would say i would i would when we do not have a say in that that has some people might say yeah i think the colours detract a little bit that is true with the ugly remote yeah okay so do you think since we yeah yeah this was a a sign criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then does that sound good what do you think three four i would say four yeah five four is fair okay okay the second one did we make it simple for new users yeah one kay okay do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users cause we have we have i would say that i think that is a one so that is a one so one yeah okay something that big okay the fourth one how about the problem of a remote being easily lost one of the nber one complaints do not lose anymore yeah it is bright yellow bright yellow is hard to lose but whether you want to or not you are not going to lose it yeah s okay it that is true do go with the with it is it is but i mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have annoying alarm or something yeah right so are we adding one of these let us add one of those features and say yes two features going to say okay two two two so we are back to a one or a two two kay okay are we technologically innovative it is technology when it comes down to yeah it is stolen technology but we from ipod yeah but there is not a lot of yellow there is not a lotta yellow right but for remotes yeah two three if we added the screaming but how many remotes do you see like this not so many really okay that is going to hurt us okay spongy material kay possibly even a five and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics if your fashion more yeah i would say we did you betcha yeah kay alright now we just gotta calculate six eight twelve sixteen seventeen divided by s is eight something well i have not done math in years just what two i dunno okay we will say two point four two right how does that look no i cannot do long very impressive it is been a while to hit oh no they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically so that is that on two oh my god okay yeah we will go with that so i have here not too shabby excellent they will not know until after they bought i yeah right nice right oh it is a specially ugly bright yellow but it is not special the say or titani they cost us all h or titani it would look really lovely yeah only have one button so really we should not be charged we should not no yeah okay leave it blank what if we completely cause the twelve point five go perfect screen here make it a besides does to our lovely remote okay so central oh that is just yeah that was just we ran out of yellow what is the blue part oh that is the batteries okay simpler looks more like a banana more criteria out there next fair enough trying to fill in some time there good just half a day you have a remote there you go yeah good teamwork but minus your well minus your powerpoint fiasco well obviously the people i work for that work for me they have just you know no i know i am yeah incom we have a list of employees that you would like fired believe me yes yes kinda the last meeting and then we will have to check with the we might have a while though

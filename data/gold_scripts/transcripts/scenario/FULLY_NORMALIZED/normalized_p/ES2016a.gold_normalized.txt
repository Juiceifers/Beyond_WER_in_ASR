okay . oh , that is not going to work . oh , alright . okay . okay . alright . , , . i will just put that there . as you all know we are here to create a brand new fantastic remote . i am nick debusk , i am the project manager . we will just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you are doing , what your what your role is . go ahead . 'kay . okay . so we have got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , acquaintance which we have kinda done . tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . so we are putting together a new remote control . we want it to be something original . of course we are a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use . we have got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design which basically is is the three of you . and w well functional design . do we have any ideas of of maybe d let us just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we are going to design it and and how we are going to do the detailing on it . so we want it to be a t_v_ remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? 'kay . -h . 'kay . i i think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . this is my first go-round with creating a remote control , so i think we are all in the same boat here . ye yeah . h . ours too . okay . so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a , i thought that would be quite good quite a good feature . like a tracking device or or like a a oh you can get those key well you could whistle ? it makes a noise , there is a button on the t_v_ that you press and , . and it would beep . yeah . . 'kay . yeah . do we want so they are kinda like long and rectangular . do we want something crazy ? you know , we want something new that is going to stand out . a m a modern so our remote should be just long . yeah . black usually . yeah . i think so . maybe sorta spherical lot more modern . 'kay . maybe the actual controls . . okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody is child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it , have to buy one every half a year ? yeah . yeah . it could be cased 'kay . so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , . so our form and our function . we want it to be easy to find . what else it what else do we want it to to do ? so we want it to be universal . it is something that we are supposed to sell for about twenty five euros and you know , goals for profits are i think somewhere around fifty million euros , what they wanna make on it , so . . 'kay . so marketing , you know , how maybe marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there . yeah 'kay . , 'cause maybe do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . some ideas ? we want it to be a b a ball , you know , we will draw up we will draw up the ball and maybe th where the buttons are located . i would i could draw sorta the ball idea . . but yeah . futuristic . -h . how would we go about making you know getting rid of our weak points ? what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? not to put you on the spot , but e no no , what did you say your title was again ? n n you are the the industrial designer . your industrial designer , so b well , the point is okay . . as yeah . there is nothing it is not new , it is not innovative , it is you know , everybody does long remote because it is easy , it is it is stable . left field , yeah . yeah . so if no , go ahead . . what something with a grip . yeah , with a grip . yeah yeah . because even i suppose even with the ball it is it might not be the easiest to hold onto . . it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we like yeah . yeah . it is d yeah . i true . i feel like i am just shooting everything down here . that is fine . you are yeah . if the remote is . okay , so unfortunately we have got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it . we have talked about our experiences with remote control and we have got a couple ideas . so let us see here . what if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball the ball function , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s to make it easier to hold on to . so you know s so it is easier to hold onto that way . course that will then remove some of our our ball . unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . yeah . so the grip is no , that would not work either . but if we are going to make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess , and then flat and then we have the problem with the hinge . so if we are flat on the bottom , it is not going to roll away , it will stay where we want . , that is true . it is probably so we do not have it flip open . too stable . we just have a ball okay , so then we forget the ball . it looks cool , but it is really not it is not functional . so we have got our sort of keyboard kind . what if we flipped it around here , so that it were it looks cool . functional . looks cool though . yeah . sorry , that does not look anything like what you had there . so it is up and down , you hold it this way . course then it is it is like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . but it is one-handed . right . right . yeah . yeah . , right . yeah . we will not yeah , because it does not have a cord , like joysticks do . you know , all that dif batteries right , and is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? so that either way you are pointing it it would work . i suppose you could do that . o of course more expensive and yeah . it will cost , so . 'kay . true . the buttons and 'kay . sorry are we out of time ? okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some . to finish . yeah . are good ideas , what are not . . must finish now , so . and then marketing will look and see what what people want . t . okay . and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . and alright , good meeting . okay . right . i am manuel and i am the industrial designer in in this project . in the functional design phase i am i will be dealing mostly with the requirements , we will discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . i suppose we will work pretty much together on that one . in the conceptual design i will be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product . and the detailed design in the detailed design i will be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , so we are pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . okay . yeah . have the same role . think they all work a noise , there is a button on the t_v_ , . it would beep . right . so . a ball . i thought maybe well there are of course certain restrictions , you cannot have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much . what are we going to build that thing out of ? how sturdy is it going to be ? do we want it to last longer or rather have people yeah . . okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? yeah . and maybe as far right . , and then you would have was that was a sorta simple right . one problem you would get with this design is the ball is a nice idea because of it is stability really , but of course , since it is a ball , it will roll , so we would have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . that is one of the big issues . also also you risk the hinges here . that is that is a problem . yeah . yeah . maybe f yeah . yeah , that is g that is a good idea . yeah . the idea it did not have to necessarily that is that is interesting of course , but that is of course a weak point , yeah . a hinge , that was just one idea though . yeah . you on the spot , but e no no , . what did you say your title was again n n you are the the industrial designer . , i am your industrial designer , so i b well , the point is that okay . well maybe i dunno . the shape is perhaps not the most ideal . as as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between stability and design here , so . well i i suppose that things become design . but i mean i -h . . . yeah . well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . so if the remote is too small it if it is small it probably looks better , but yeah . may not be th as functional . so for that there is so the question is also , i dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? true . so we do not have it flip open . it is probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so i do not know if a lid is a good idea . from stabil stability point of view it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , the more we sell . so it is do not make it too stable . to the other design . something along those things then . it looks cool , but it is really not it looks cool . looks cool though . yeah . functional functional . points . but right . right . yeah . yeah . question is what makes those game pads functional ? w i think that is pretty much the form for full hand . so it is a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that is the essential part . except for that i think we will not probably not get a get away from some longer design . . 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . yeah , because it does not have a cord , like joysticks you know , all that dif batteries right , and batteries go weak as well , so after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? so , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . that either way you are pointing it it would work . more expensive and yeah i suppose you could do that . o of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it will cost , so . course you can do that . true . i mean of course it will be evident after a while or if you look at it , it will it will be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the nbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but it is rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you do not have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work . put it . let us . obviously does it say what does it say for n it alright . around , be a little bit more prepared . hiya , i am ryan . i am the user interface designer . likewise i have three different roles for each stage of design . the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . and the detailed design sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions , what makes wha how we are going to make it special . that is about it . yeah . . tool training yeah . well s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function . 'kay . oh right . i suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person is house . but , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , voles and then prograing . . . i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i do not actually know . but is it just infra-red ? is that standard ? i think yeah , yeah ye yeah . one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . so we should we should set so if there is a g a way of finding it quite easily , i thought that would be quite good quite a good feature . ch or or like a a it makes a noise , there is oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it would beep . and yeah . generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . . do we want just long . rectangular . do we want something yeah . black usually . know , we want something yeah . . a m a modern i think so . should be maybe sorta spherical or something . a ball . yeah . 'kay . . people i thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . type thing . the same time yeah . we want it to be half a year yeah . ball-shaped yeah . , then it it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . ye one small . all a ball , you know , we will draw up we will draw up the i would i could draw sorta the ball idea . my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it is connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle maybe a hinge that will have to be the strongest part of it . if that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you would have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . thing is inside i think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , as few buttons inside as possible . , i dunno , what is the idea for . just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . it is looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair . but yeah . futuristic -h . that was that was a sorta simple idea i had and then you know you could about right right , it would almost be like a ball . so that was just just an idea i had . i do not know whether anybody else has other ideas ? really yeah . we would have yeah . one side at least maybe f yeah . . also also yeah , that is g that is a good idea . . that is that is a problem . that is yeah . the idea it did not have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though . . yeah . stability and design here , so . well i i suppose that things become design . but i mean i -h . yeah . it is not new , it is not innovative , it is i was trying to think of like the design of others . i cannot think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there is nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . easy yeah . yeah . games i think definitely doing something different is a good idea . i mean maybe design something , that is sort of like i suppose not everybody is everybody is hand is the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . . yeah , with a grip . . yeah . it is it might not be the easiest to hold onto it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . the the like yeah . , so maybe yeah . we it is d yeah . i think it is definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . . . so it is easier yeah . to the other design . but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . course then it is yeah . an instinctual put it 'kay . even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , is not a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . so if that is your thing and you got something like that instead , and there is your s you kn you know which way you are going to pointing it . yeah . to interrupt let us . obviously does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , i think . finish t alright , , . . okay . i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role . in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i will be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i will be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . . tool training , project . h . , so i think we are all in the same boat here . ours too . so . a way of finding ch like a tracking device like a tracking device ? and yeah . . be good . that is going to stand out lot more modern . maybe like user-friendly , like a little people you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . . . . . also since we are partners of the international remote control association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . that is more on the research end , but the marketing . out there . yeah . 'kay . ye small . and maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one will not apply to all of the countries we are targeting . , to be fair . futuristic . that ? you are the , i am your industrial designer . , so here . but -h . so if no , go ahead . 'kay , i will draw something . what ? my idea was just to have it be kind of like a yeah . keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky . we could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . i do not know . that is my idea . yeah . with a grip . yeah , with a grip . yeah . , so maybe yeah . true . . . that is fine . you are the boss , you are allowed to . yeah if the remote yeah . . it looks cool , but it is really not it looks cool . looks cool though . yeah . , only with a couple of jutting out points right . right yeah . , right . right . you got something like that instead yeah . are we out of time . sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . yeah . want . great . around , be a little bit more prepared

okay right okay alright is everyone here okay this is our conceptual design meeting yep yep and ill just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes then each of you will have your presentation and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control and then well have forty minutes for finishing up ill go through the mee through the minutes first we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available we decided that or we know that we need to use company colours company logo and our marketing expert gave us some i information from interviews with a hundred different remote users with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before people thought their remotes were ugly that remotes zap a lot they only use a finite amount of buttons and that they often lose the its easy to lose a remote which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple and some sort of locator either a button or tracking device and that it should look different than whats out there kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition the younger people said they wanted it older people did not i think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it and that it was probably a giick that would increasingly wear on the consers nerves then the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote the simple versus the the complex the simple one being better for a user the complex better for an engineer and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a useroriented remote something simple and that we didnt wanna go with a universal remote because increasing cost and increasing complexity we would just have a t_v_ remote and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote have it s be something that looks different and finally our industrial designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work from energy source what we would use batteries because we dont wanna have a a cable how that would power the remote and the lamp if we were to to have one the user interface then would connect to a chip which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the t_v_ i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be something that will fit into easily into someones hand and with a just a few buttons just the basics and with a scrolling function also okay and i will leave that leave it at that so marketing were watching trends i suppose that you can have this okay yep can i have your cable please a banana shape oh it was sort of banana shaped or vegetable yeah yeah outside so maybe we could have something thats somewhat removable so possibly like a sorry just to butt in for a second possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones alright thats what i was thinking you have one with a flag and one with a banana and one thats a spongy of spongy ones feel to it you can when you buy your remote you can buy various covers whats it called cust we could leave that to the cover department yeah h we all know theyve got nothing to do all day huge things which is thats industrial your gr ninety year old grandma yeah notice the giant dog bone shape also good for animals makes sense makes sense and that yeah yeah see dunno just to whats the approximate per hundred thousand for the titani oh fya i dont have an information on that however i was given an okay to use it of that but i was given an okay works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so always the you but exactly yeah y probably not yeah no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go alright no h yeah just all be sort of spongy so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want or the rubbery we cannot not much originality really kay we wanted it but cannot add thats the tricky thing yeah and is that an option a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots s certainly what about a smell t to the remote just designwise nice one you could just sell it in different colours yellow and grey so grapefruit grapefruit i would say if i were to make a decision i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectr of of importance yeah i think having yeah like well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruitminded remote buyer yeah and if its yellow its its yellow its curved i its yellow which is a company colour grey buttons its sort of couple of couple of grey stripes we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over it would look like a banana just sitting on their table why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana yeah on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey rather than rather th it could and then you could actually h put the bananashaped maybe the holder if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a fruit could be it could be an ape or a fruit bowl hey we could have a variety of options here it could be an ape it was yeah yeah nice could look like a fruit bowl do you have more to your presentation oh the materials okay im gonna plug in here real quick if i could sure hang on there like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here ow ow h so okay so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source the chiponprint and the case probably case material and probably a shape also and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what what the type is and what kind of supplements well have energy source i think weve i think weve decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet and we have five minutes kay right so i guess we should pick the case then if we go with the plasticky case or the the plastic case then the chiponprint is still kind of we could have either or we could have a complex one or a a noncomplex but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us yeah just maybe yeah finger grips just okay so we would we would have the l_c_d_ screen kay so i guess the case would be plastic with perhaps thats not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it its more of a su its more of a supplement maybe m yeah yeah which will require a more expensive chiponprint right kay so i guess that is that is that about it so we have a good idea of what were gonna need to to do on this okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes heres whats gonna be going on ryan youll be working on the user interface design manuel youll be working on the lookandfeel design corrine well want a product evaluation and the two of you get to play with the modelling components and maybe and and get us a prototype which should go along well with your lookandfeel design and your interface so that basically just be working on the prototype well accomplish your other two actions alright okay lets do it that you can have please most important theme for cloths like a alright h we all know theyve got so thats industrial design for cranes stuff like that yeah yeah notice the giant dog makes sense makes sense and that yeah also yeah crazy well lets see im going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit the stuff in there ive more information on possible materials as well what we can and cannot do but lets just wait for this to load up and ill show you what were talking about here okay the details of the components design as you can see there what we have is the board main board of the remote control the underside thats pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip which is the what we were talking about this was is the device to recognise the signals the input and it passes it on to a row of further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal which later on is being is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal its getting and will do what you tell it so much for the the workings of the of the remote control itself its job is to wait for you to press a key then to translate that key press into infrared light signals that are received by the television when you press a key you complete a specific connection the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button right pretty clear transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light and seeing the signal reacts appropriately this is the circuit board from the other side the lower part of it i dont know if you can see that properly with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over you can see the circuit board itself thats the cheapest way to make electronic connections basically on the market what you do is you have dont have cables but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board these are the actual keys that are being pressed they close the electric circuit that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side that would be behind here which sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it the way it works is that you have the keys here the rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side which closes the circuit here and thus gives on the signal now this is the simple version we are talking this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time we are talking something more complicated of course its going to be more expensive as well and not only that we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell ive gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic rubber as well rubber that is used in these antistress balls so its pretty squishy that would that would serve that purpose we could also use wood or titani spongy oh fya i dont have an information on that however our company obviously can provide us with with the titani so i asse im i was given an okay to use it it certainly is an expensive material im aware of that but i was given an okay but there are certain restrictions to certain materials now lets first go through the list with the materials so we what we can use is plastic rubber wood and titani can also mix these as for the energy source we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting what we could use is or what i was offered or what we could use is a basic bateer battery right a dynamo interestingly enough we could use solar cells or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy such as like watches you know where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr provides it with with some energy so obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really you dont wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right solar cell is interesting may fail though every here and there yeah or you know you lose it it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah yeah yeah works well in arizona but always the you in edinburgh not so but exactly the kinetic energy thing might work but the same problem you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work so id say what were stuck with really is the basic battery yeah y probably not yeah which also makes a base station basically obsolete we dont need that then however our interface options are pushbuttons in which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert however weve discussed that scroll wheels are a better option and they are possible we have an okay for scroll wheels okay however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod ive one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as well this however may exclude certain materials if you have a squishy kind of remote control then an l_c_d_ screen may be affected by the movement hence we might not be able to put it in there so theres also restrictions to when it comes to the chip if we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic setup that we that ive just presented the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well i dont have any details to when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference id rather say drop the titani and therefore lets have a more sophisticated chip but thats not up to me to decide really so thats for the for the scroll wheel it limits our choice and squishy is hip so id say no i think i rather not go for for that lets see now solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control but obviously thats not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells i asse right or is anybody still alright yeah no h are probably the way to go alright which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i asse yeah with the titani we cannot make it a curved design we would just be able to make it flat and and yeah a straight design pretty much which i asse would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions you can have an l_c_d_ screen but therefore no rubber will be used alright so plastic yes titani yes but this will of course influence the form with plastic as i understand it you can use any form latex the ipod right is tricky or rubber and and titani also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular add an l_c_d_ screen and then you can basically choose either plastic or titani or wood even if you wanna make it a particular shape use plastic yeah so the ru wait the rubbery add an l_c_d_ screen add a scroll wheel thatll be fine or make it just pushbuttons basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options maybe not the nicest feel or not much originality really yeah kay with rubber we could sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it but we cannot add scroll wheels and we cannot add an l_c_d_ screen thats the tricky thing at certain spots s certainly can be done yes yeah if that doesnt affect the functional side of it all like say just the underside or so then it can be done i asse yeah yeah so the fruit design how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control say we dont make it p a particular fruit shape obviously but give it like the surface of an orange banana whatever you name it what about a smell just designwise remote nice one i dont yeah yellow and grey well we were supposed to stick to the company colours though thats yellow and grey so what have we lemon banana is co stick to the colours yeah oh yeah yellow and grey grapefruit is what wed go for when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps but well we have it bananashaped already kind of so yeah well we kinda do yeah right and yellow its curved i its yellow colour grey buttons its sort of couple of couple of grey stripes well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana yeah rather there you go rather th it could and then you could actually h put the bananashaped thing on be shaped like a fruit could be it could be an ape or a fruit bowl hey we it could be an ape yeah yeah here yeah oh okay thats pretty much it i informed you about the materials what the interior has to look like and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go if i could sure hang on there you go well we can still design a twopiece remote without having a base having one of them be a base station but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions or you take out the smaller piece we can still do that yeah yeah h however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much so which then as i understand it would probably limit the limit again the the the use of certain materials because they would be too expensive say like have a scroll wheel and on both of them or have an l_c_d_ screen and so on so on youd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there but could be done of course right okay when it comes to the chiponprint as i said the the more advanced features you want the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive if you want just a normal button version the chiponprint is gonna be kay a cheap one right but yeah as long as the pla the rubber is nowhere near the controls yes a su its more of a m more of a l lamination perhaps yeah yes it does right right yep a banana shape oh it was sort of banana shaped or vegetable yeah yeah right you have one with a flag those like yeah sort of spongy ones thinking yeah one various covers whats it called cust you personalised yeah personalise your remote yeah okay why cant i see the crazy yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to will use the conser will use the actual device so ive looked at some of the stuff i was sent try and get some inspiration but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had i was sent some information from the company saying that they the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you can program questions into such devices they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question you program the answer and the machine responds accordingly okay theres different ways of a user can use products l like a remote theres a graphical use where you you look at pictures and well on a screen a coand line where you obviously type things in and you get a response and then it ju thats just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes you cant really see that picture well but theres various different remotes once again with lots of different buttons on making it more complicated so then i had a look at new products that are on the market not necessarily remote controls but ones that youll recognise this is the voice there is a voice recognition remote control which can control mus multiple devices i have a there is a picture you surf your favourite channels with your voice store up to eighty speech samples controls four devices t_v_ cable satellite v_c_r_ d_v_d_ and audio and you can record your own v verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions so the technology is there the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting where there has scroll down functions on the side you can sort of just make those out and then on the right is obviously an ipod which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there and really is and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through that is a possibility and nothings simpler really then theres things like this which is a a a kids remote where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch and it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control so i dont know if theres a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components maybe it can have more components you know different remotes the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your devices as to what you know things you use sometimes an arrow pointing down which may suggest vole down could become confused just as a v_ for vole just little things like that which would need to be made clear in the design i think d carrying on from what ive already said a user friendly remote with minim buttons maybe weve so suggested this twopart thing where if it was to have a speech recognition thing you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit and then just have the simple sort of handheld thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote i dont it could be a graphical display the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus stuff like gets more and more compli complicated and then the the handheld bit should be ergonomically designed and that is it why am i oh yeah just where are we just to sort of show you m theyve even got things like that huge things which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah for cranes stuff like that yeah yeah notice the giant dog bone makes sense makes sense and that yeah good for animals yeah see things whys my screen crazy whats the approximate out of the question yeah or would you have to leave it by the window yeah for a week and yeah not so exactly yeah not yeah is anybody still yeah alright yeah yeah would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff so i dont know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic but then where do people hold it just all be sort of spongy like a covering yeah spongy parts you can have an l_c_d_ so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it like a screen like the ipod right or wood even yeah add an l_c_d_ yeah yeah could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen and then j just sort of that initial shape we had just which is sort of bananaesque so thats thing if we did it yellow and you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thb bit they wouldnt have any theyre just on the exterior they wouldnt be necessary to the actual shape of the thing the functional yeah t to the well we were you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose in different ye yellows i dont suppose we have to stick to co bright citrus colours yeah to the company stick to the colours yeah oh yeah grapefruit grapefruit grapefruit lower end of the yeah yeah kind of yeah do yeah yeah remote buyer its its yellow right i its yellow and if it if it was done yellow which is a company colour and if its yellow couple of grey stripes yeah person could turn it over it would look like a banana on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey there yeah th maybe it could and then you could actually h put the bananashaped thing on the fruit bowl on the coffee table and then people would always know where it was oh be yeah hey we could have a variety yeah well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery and the base station might not be necessary oh remote yeah station but yeah just just maybe yeah just a little bit of the finger grips just on top of the plastic its more of a su yeah yeah yeah i think so i think yeah okay which should go okay yep yep were okay i suppose that you can have this yep can i have your cable please thanks okay so i was looking at trendwatching unfortunately i wasnt given too much information i was given a brief executive suary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at and then ill just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that okay the most important finding was that the fancy lookandfeel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional lookandfeel design which i think weve kind of already discussed before the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative and again these are all things weve kind of already come up with on our own but this just backs it up and thirdly the remote would be easy to use as far as fashion update weve learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths shoes and furniture so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can try and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel okay so from that as weve already said we need to focus on a fancy lookandfeel i think weve already discovered that its kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design but i think that even if its very subtle we need to kind of trick our consers so they at least get the idea that theyre getting something thats new and modern and sleek and whether its through the shape or the colours or all of that for technologically innovative weve talked about the tracking device we brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further and manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface discussing some of those that we could change a little bit we need to keep it simple have limited buttons which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for a banana shape oh it was sort of banana shaped we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables i dont know i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable yeah yeah right or with exterior designs but my question is i mean the stereotypically speaking you kind of picture males with their remote controls and im not sure how theyd feel about having fruity logos on the outside so maybe we could have something thats somewhat removable or i dont know different options for female male target groups and then the spongy feel i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology thats out there c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongyfeeling remote controls so thats that sorry mobile phones those like yeah thats what i was thinking yeah one feel to it you yeah so when you buy your remote you can buy various whats it called various coverings personalised yeah personalise your remote yeah h your gr ninety year old grandma yeah notice makes sense and that yeah dunno that that would spongy fya i dont have an information on that however our company i was really you dont not so exactly yeah y probably not yeah it starts or i think i think batteries alright no h sort of a a s a cover on it which is just like a covering yeah the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts so they can remove it shape obviously t to the remote nice one you ye yellows i dont suppose we have to stick to bright citrus colours yeah the company colours though thats yellow and grey yeah oh yeah yellow and grey grapefruit is what lower end of the spectr of yeah yeah i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous like bananashaped already kind of yeah well we kinda do yeah remote buyer and if its yellow its curved grey buttons yeah of couple of grey stripes it look like a banana yeah just sitting on their table rather th it could and then you could actually h put the bananashaped thing on the coffee oh if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like it could nice could look like a fruit bowl could be it could yeah of options here kay so is the two piece idea out or have we not decided oh right okay you take out youd probably but the chiponprint is just well what about what you said like putting the maybe yeah just a little bit of finger grips just on top of the plastic m more of a yeah so then for the scroll are we going for the ipod type so i think yeah okay modelling components

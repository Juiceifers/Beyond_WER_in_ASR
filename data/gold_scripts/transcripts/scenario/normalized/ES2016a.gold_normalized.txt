okay oh thats not gonna work oh alright okay okay um alright uh uh um ill just put that there uh as you all know were here to create a brand new fantastic remote uh im nick debusk im the project manager uh well just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what youre doing what your what your role is um go ahead kay okay um so weve got our opening our our agenda is the opening uh acquaintance which weve kinda done uh tool training project plan discussion and then closing uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here um so we are putting together a new remote control um we want it to be something original um of course were a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use um weve got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um and w uh well um functional design um um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d lets just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go into how were gonna design it and and how were gonna do the detailing on it so we want it to be um a t_v_ remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote kay mmhmm kay i i think yeah yeah r universal remote um this is my first uh goround with creating a remote control so i think were all in the same boat here ye yeah huh ours too um okay mm so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh i thought thatd be quite good quite a good feature like a tracking device or or like a a oh you can get those key well you could whistle it makes a noise theres a button on the t_v_ that you press and mm mm and itd beep yeah mm kay yeah do we want so theyre kinda like long and rectangular do we want something crazy you know we want something new thats gonna stand out a m a modern so our remote should be just long yeah black usually yeah i think so maybe sorta spherical lot more modern kay maybe the actual controls um mm okay so yeah so we want it to be sturdy we want it to to hold up to somebodys child you know throwing it across the room or as you said people kinda throw it so ballshaped uh you know if it were ballshaped maybe then it have to buy one every half a year yeah yeah it could be cased kay um so we want it to be modern fun sturdy um so our form and our function um we want it to be um easy to find um what else it what else do we want it to to do so we want it to be universal its something that were supposed to sell for about twenty five euros um and you know goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros what they wanna make on it so mm kay so marketing you know how maybe uh marketing you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there yeah kay cause maybe um do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there some ideas we want it to be a b a ball you know well draw up well draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located id i could draw sorta the ball idea but yeah futuristic uhhuh how would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball not to put you on the spot but e no no uh uh what did you say your title was again n n youre the the industrial designer your industrial designer so b well the point is okay as yeah theres nothing its not new its not innovative its you know everybody does long remote because its easy its its stable um left field yeah yeah so if no go ahead what something with a grip yeah with a grip mm yeah yeah because even i suppose even with the ball its it might not be the easiest to hold onto um mm it still not the ho easiest thing to hold yeah so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better but then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda so maybe maybe we like yeah yeah its d yeah i true i feel like im just shooting everything down here uh um thats fine youre yeah if the remote is okay so unfortunately weve got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it um weve talked about our experiences with remote control and um weve got a couple ideas um so lets see here what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to so you know um s so its easier to hold onto that way course thatll then remove some of our our ball unless this unless this part were raised so say the cover flips over and covers that part yeah so the grip is no that wouldnt work either um but if were gonna make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball anyways so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess um and then flat uh and then we have the problem with the hinge so if were flat on the bottom its not gonna roll away itll stay where we want mm thats true its probably so we dont have it flip open too stable uh we just have a ball okay so then we forget the ball it looks cool but its really not its not functional um so weve got our sort of keyboard kind what if we flipped it around here so that it were um it looks cool uh functional looks cool though yeah sorry that doesnt look anything like what you had there um so its up and down you hold it this way course then its its like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points but its onehanded um right right yeah yeah right mm yeah well not yeah because it doesnt have a cord like joysticks do you know all that dif batteries right and is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side so that either way youre pointing it it would work i suppose you could do that o of course more expensive and yeah itll cost so kay um true the buttons and kay sorry are we out of time okay well just to finish up should we s go with this plan start making some mm to finish yeah are good ideas what are not uh must finish now so and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want t mm okay and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around be a little bit more prepared and uh alright good meeting okay right im manuel and im the industrial designer in in this project um in the functional design phase im ill be dealing mostly with the requirements um well discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on um i suppose well work pretty much together on that one um um in the conceptual design um ill be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product and uh the detailed design in the detailed design ill be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself um so were pretty much working together obviously on the design front here okay yeah have the same role mm think they all work a noise theres a button on the t_v_ mm mm itd beep right so a ball mm i thought maybe well there are of course certain restrictions you cant have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that refers to the material pretty much um what are we gonna build that thing out of how sturdy is it gonna be do we want it to last longer or rather have people yeah mm okay so yeah so we want it to be sturdy whatever have to buy one every half a year yeah and maybe as far right and then youd have was that was a sorta simple right one problem youd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of its stability really but of course since its a ball itll roll so wed have to have it flat on one side at least down here somewhere take away that part thats one of the big issues also also you risk the hinges here thats thats um a problem yeah yeah maybe f yeah yeah thats g thats a good idea yeah the idea it didnt have to necessarily thats thats interesting of course but thats of course a weak point yeah a hinge that was just one idea though yeah you on the spot but e no no uh uh what did you say your title was again n n youre the the industrial designer uh im your industrial designer so i b well the point is that okay well maybe i dunno the shape is perhaps not the most ideal as as stable as it is there must be a compromise between um stability and design here so well i i suppose that things become design but i mean i mmhmm mm um mm yeah well with the onehanded design you also have the the problem of the size w cause you know from cell phones they can be too small so if the remote is too small it if its small it probably looks better but yeah may not be th as functional so for that theres so the question is also i dunno d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it true so we dont have it flip open its probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway so i dont know if a lid is a good idea from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident uh the more we sell so its dont make it too stable uh to the other design something along those things then it looks cool but its really not it looks cool looks cool though yeah functional uh functional points but right right yeah yeah question is what makes those game pads functional w i think thats pretty much the form for full hand so its a round shape underneath that makes it comfy right makes it nice so thats the essential part except for that i think well not probably not get a get away from some longer design mm cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing yeah because it doesnt have a cord like joysticks you know all that dif batteries right and batteries go weak as well so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it right so have to m show which is the front which is the back that either way youre pointing it it would work more expensive and yeah i suppose you could do that o of course the more technology you stick in that the more itll cost so course you can do that true i mean of course itll be evident after a while or if you look at it itll itll be evident which way around to point it since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff but um its rather about an instinctual thing like you just grab it you dont have to s look at it you know which way around to point it otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work put it mm lets obviously does it say what does it say for n it alright around be a little bit more prepared hiya im ryan um im the user interface designer um likewise ive three different roles for each stage of design um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control um in the concept design the user interface how the user reacts with the the product and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design what they might be looking for uh things like fashions what makes wha how were gonna make it special thats about it um yeah uh tool training yeah well uh s function of remote control is just just you know change channels is its main function kay oh right i suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one persons house but you know they all sorta have the same role changing channels volumes and then programming mm mm i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i dont actually know but is it just infrared is that standard i think yeah yeah ye yeah um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose em so we should we should set so if theres a g a way of finding it quite easily i thought thatd be quite good quite a good feature ch or or like a a it makes a noise theres oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and itd beep and yeah generally all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance do we want just long rectangular do we want something yeah black usually know we want something yeah a m a modern i think so should be maybe sorta spherical or something a ball yeah kay mm people i thought maybe because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball and maybe the actual controls are inside or something type thing the same time yeah we want it to be half a year yeah ballshaped yeah then it it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside ye one small all a ball you know well draw up well draw up the id i could draw sorta the ball idea my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you this is where its connected together and then when you open it out it could fol it could be maybe flip like a flip phone and then when you fold it out the middle maybe a hinge thatll have to be the strongest part of it if that if we did use a hinge or if it was just two parts and then youd have just sorta you you you know your buttons thing is inside i think sometimes remotes have too many buttons so maybe as simple as possible um as few buttons inside as possible um i dunno whats the idea for just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it its looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though to be fair but yeah futuristic uhhuh that was that was a sorta simple idea i had and then you know you could about right right it would almost be like a ball so that was just just an idea i had i dont know whether anybody else has other ideas really yeah wed have yeah one side at least maybe f yeah also also yeah thats g thats a good idea thats thats um a problem thats yeah the idea it didnt have to necessarily be f a hinge that was just one idea though yeah um stability and design here so well i i suppose that things become design but i mean i mmhmm yeah its not new its not innovative its i was trying to think of like the design of others i cant think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote maybe small sort of fatter ones but theres nothing being done sort of out of left field yeah easy yeah yeah games i think definitely doing something different is a good idea i mean maybe design something thats sort of like uh i suppose not everybodys everybodys hands the same but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier yeah with a grip yeah its it might not be the easiest to hold onto it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold yeah the the like yeah so maybe yeah we its d yeah i think its definitely got to be a a onehanded a onehanded job mm uh so its easier yeah to the other design but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then course then its yeah an instinctual put it kay even if you designed it in some in a way that you know isnt a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had definite points so if thats your thing and you got something like that instead and theres your s you kn you know which way youre gonna pointing it yeah um to interrupt uh lets obviously does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting i think finish t alright uh uh um okay i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and ill be doing research to figure this out in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and ill be doing marketing research on the web and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did uh tool training project mm huh so i think were all in the same boat here ours too so mm a way of finding ch like a tracking device like a tracking device and yeah mm be good thats gonna stand out lot more modern maybe like userfriendly like a little people you know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard type thing mm mm mm also since were partners of the international remote control association maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal thats more on the research end but the marketing out there yeah kay ye small and maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences cause maybe one wont apply to all of the countries were targeting to be fair futuristic that youre the uh im your industrial designer so here but mmhmm so if no go ahead kay ill draw something what my idea was just to have it be kind of like a yeah keyboard type shape you know like video games l so but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky we could also try to do the hinge thing so it could like flip out that way i dont know thats my idea yeah with a grip yeah with a grip mm yeah so maybe yeah true mm uh um thats fine youre the boss youre allowed to yeah if the remote yeah it looks cool but its really not it looks cool looks cool though yeah only with a couple of jutting out points right right yeah right mm right you got something like that instead yeah are we out of time mm um sorry to interrupt but we have a warning to finish yeah want mm great around be a little bit more prepared

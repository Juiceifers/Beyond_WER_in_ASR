yep soon as i get this okay this is our last meeting um ill go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting uh and then well have a the prototype presentation um then we will um do an evaluation uh or well see what what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation then well go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget um then well do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that well need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line um lets see minutes from the last meeting um we looked at uh the the trends we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy lookandfeel it was twice as important as anything else um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles um and a spongy feel so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote um looking at other other devices um the ipod we really liked the look of that um we also had uh the kids remote for a simple idea um a two part remote which was what were were originally looking at uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use but i think weve still decided not to go with that then we looked at the components um the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote um and basically how what were making for the prototype so im going to leave it at that and let you guys take over the prototype yeah do you need a this okay but very nice where you where youd mmhmm so yeah much make much difference what but whats that button not do it at all just uh kay onoff button kay right um would you like to uh right but well done well luckily we are going to find out or not luckily um do you have a marketing presentation for us i do i think its definitely different than anything else out there so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say i would say most definitely its bright yeah i would its mm it still has your traditional black yep not angular it mm pretty much by the company yep uh to definitely yeah yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form right right yeah yeah i would say five four yeah four is fair okay very noncommittal four yeah kay mmhmm channel and volume s scrolling through and selecting a few scrolling further yeah i think thats a one lose anymore yeah its bright whether you want so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could mentioned just just to use and it is quite bright and what yeah uh s okay yeah i mean a million but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it then our scale goes up quite a bit i think oh yeah mm probably two you know if we eliminate the fact that you know its impossible to guarantee that its not gonna be lost then yeah id say two with the speech recognition which of course may be changed depending on budget which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a so far yes yeah its you have theyre cheap some sort of proximity technology for suitcases yeah pray that you dont accidentally lose that piece right thatd be tough then yeah okay two two kay its comes down to technology but we yeah but theres not a lot of yellow theres not a lotta yellow course that wasnt really we were kinda forced to take that colour right right right right fa but for remotes yeah i dont know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth yeah not really cause its stolen no maybe not but if we added the screaming factor then we go up um i would say were probably at four right so many really we have some spongy yeah that kind of sort yeah as much as no one would be the yeah because its only got what these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back to fold and stuff yeah yeah probably a four at most at most possibly even a five and lastly y yes if your fashion is b is carmen miranda you betcha more yeah did its true and the way you operate seven is two point two point four is that some long division something well i havent done math and what what is the acceptable criteria is there like a scale that we have to hit oh no it alright then okay well lets see now we get to do the budget numbers you didnt know that you were gonna have a budget but we do okay yeah yeah so i have here an fifty percent not too shabby yeah we want a fifty percent profit on this oh you cant really see that very well twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us okay so well lets see the f the um wonder if i can make this what the oh it wont let me do that okay alright so at top i dont know if you guys can read that or not i cant cause i dont have my glasses on but so weve got the energy source theres uh four five six categories we have energy source electronics case then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements battery okay so uh first of all energy source we picked battery um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take probably some e either two or four two like it at four its gonna excellent they wont know until after they this is consumerism alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chiponprint regular chiponprint advanced chiponprint sample sensor sample speaker kay we have one of those kay then the case is a probably its double curved double curved yes case materials are plastic plastic um i guess its two since one for the top one for the bottom is that right or is it just one n no maybe its one because of the one kay yeah i guess it doesnt matter cause the price on that one is zero which is nice special colour exactly right oh interface type we have pushbutton scrollwheel interface integrated scrollwheel pushbutton and an l_c_d_ display but its not special s s thats yeah so we actually have the l_c_d_ display and then is it the integrated or is it id say the integrated yeah unfortunately kay button supplement special colour um special form special material mm say mahogany or so or titanium they cost us all the same mmhmm or titanium remote yeah well we only have one button so really we shouldnt be charged we shouldnt be charged anything for the the button supplements just no thats getting a bit tiny um okay were gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l_c_d_ and scroll so our total is fifteen point five which i believe is yeah thats too much by three euros over huh so the only thing better than um a bananashaped remote is one that you shake if it w what yeah cause the well cause we have to have both right yeah mmhmm so so we may not need the l_c_d_ display uh well there we go twelve point five perfect there we go perfect okay so we just remove our screen here make it a bigger besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote back to the design room boys so okay so the costs under twelve point five euro was no we redesigned it now its yes next slide project evaluation uh project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found um yeah so i guess that lets see here i think that perhaps the project evaluations just supposed to be completed by me but id like to hear your thoughts fair enough trying to fill in some time there uh h what did you think of our project process yeah i think we did good good teamwork yeah i think we sort of knew where we st we started off a little little weak our leadership was quite weak in the beginning um um straight away i thought but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing um room for creativity there was that um i think we tried a lotta different things and um i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things um you guys worked together well as a team and um the means which was the whiteboard and the pens yeah weve used the whiteboard i had some problem with the pen i think but minus your p well thats not my minus your powerpoint fiasco well that work yeah just you have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired heads are gonna roll believe me okay n new ideas found um yes for the remote maybe no not f for technology alright closing costs are within the budget project is evaluated um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary thats it and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting actually um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up and then well have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that but thats the end of our meeting a while though can try to plug that in there but there is our remo right thats what we have there thats plastic plastic covered with rubber we might anything you want to add mmhmm uh add some more underneath here maybe give it give it a form i mean youre supposed to hold it like that but um just if you grab it take it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah exactly use both might as well think about yeah doesnt make much make much difference you could work lefthanded or righthanded i suppose t the actual thing might be th think about the button as well like either put either one one on either side or yeah whats that button uh kay not do it at all its a quick onoff button thats um just the on and off yeah i think its pretty important so you dont have to fiddle with that right um thats not um id say a bit smaller would probably be nice you wanna play with that over there there you go yeah its you to uh right um yep not angular angles to it id say when it comes to the ergonomics the form and stuff yes thats definitely more beautiful than your average however the colour we dont have a say in that yeah i think the colours detract a little mm yep that has been that has been dictated pretty much by the company so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly definitely s nothing you can say about that i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form but say it yeah yeah yeah thats true yeah a a modern right right its different you dont want your uh three feet huge l_c_d_ dis display in your living room thats hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that yeah what do you think very noncommittal yeah is fair okay its very intuitive i think yeah s give it a one aim one of the main aims that we had one mmhmm right which are channel right so thats a one one yeah something that big and that yellow you just dont lose anymore yeah complaints whether bright yellows hard to lose but um if we were to youre not gonna lose it oops dont think youd hmm its not gonna fall and it is quite bright well what uh s okay mm true i think probably two oh yeah you probably yeah mm with the y you could add an extra feature actually which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television which which may we could add that but thats nothing we have thought of so far were just a yes its its key rings you have theyre cheap yeah some sort of proximity um the its based on this anti antitheft technology for suitcases and stuff where you have one piece thats attached to your luggage another piece that starts beeping that cant cost much expensive yeah so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other stick it on the t_v_ right thatd be tough then well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television yeah ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control okay lets add one of those features and say yes gonna say okay so were back to a one two two two kay uh so its all just remote controls its but theres not a lot of yellow theres not a lotta yellow course that wasnt really we were kinda forced to take its all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right yeah its stolen technology but we have fa from ipod yeah but for remotes yeah you the truth yeah not really not but if we added not so many um right we have some spongy yeah yeah well you have that kind of sort of yeah as much as no its not a one though one would be the whole thing got what to fold and stuff the bottom yeah probably a four so thats a four at most if your fashion y yes more yeah id say we did you betcha yeah its true well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l_c_d_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour but it definitely is on the yeah be what we two im impressed i cant do that without a calculator no i cant do long very impressive its been a while pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate so i have here an yeah we want a fifty percent fifty percent youre kidding p not too shabby its too much lets see um uh i cant cause i dont have my glasses four battery two two at four its gonna be too heavy so that thats not our problem people can change it every month excellent they wont know until after they bought it this is consumerism sample sensor thats the advanced chiponprint yeah double curved double curved yes plastic plastic is that right or is it just one maybe its one because n no no thats just one kay its just one mo single mould we can do that yeah which is nice special exactly right oh thats not a special colour its a specially ugly colour but its not special bright yellow integrated scrollwheel s yeah yes unfortunately we could of course make the buttons wood say mahogany or so or titanium they cost us all mmhmm or titanium yeah well we only have uh just really we shouldnt be charged we shouldnt be charged anything for the no thats getting a bit tiny is yeah thats too much its hard to believe so well go for the hand dynamo huh took out the the one single button weve got mmhmm i mean lets lets face it it also depends on the software on the on the television you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen so s yeah lets take away the yeah yeah you could maybe take yeah yeah display even if it if it so right right we may not need it well there we go there you go perfect there we go screen screen easier to use besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote back to the design okay the so we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go central oh thats just yeah that was just we ran out of yellow whats the blue part oh thats the batteries okay there you go oops there you go even there you go one more criteria all those fruit lovers out there uh fair enough trying to fill in some time there great i think we did yeah i think we yeah just half a day you have a remote there you go yeah right i super super minus your p well well thats not my fault thats obviously the people i work for uh that work for me uh theyve just you know fiasco no i know im yeah incom have a we have a list of employees heads are gonna roll believe me yes yes well have to check with the though the prototype the prototype discussion okay no can try to plug that in there but there is our remo the banana um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned its basically designed around a banana um but it would be held in such a fashion where it is obviously it wouldnt be that floppy cause this would be hard plastic very nice these would be like the rubber the rubber grips so thats so that would hopefully help with grip or like the ergonomics of it um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel you have to use your imagination a little bit and this here represents the screen where you where youd go through and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod where that one way ch through channels that way th other way through channels volume up and down and then to access the more complicated functions youd you sorta go you press that and go through the menus its that that simple that just represents the infrared uh beam right thats thats a simple on and off switch um i dont know we could use the voice t that blue bits should be yellow d that thatd be where the batteries would be i suppose and um thats about it its as simple as you we could make it really is there anything you want to add mmhmm it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah exactly yeah doesnt make much make much difference you could work lefthanded or righthanded i suppose think about th think about the button as well like either t the actual thing might be smaller yeah uh its a quick onoff just the on and off you yeah would you like to go right its you know its flimsy cause its made out of heavy playdoh but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose with the scroll and the l_c_d_ i think its else out there yeah i would say i would i would its bright its its curved its not theres no sharp yep angles to it that has been that has some people might say it yeah bit yeah with yeah yeah s yeah i think that was the main aim one of the main aims that we had mmhmm s scrolling through and selecting a few right uh yeah cause weve weve brought it down to basically four controls most common which are channel and volume and then the other ones are just a matter of just going just scrolling further yeah id say that so if we dont lose anymore yeah its bright yellow bright yellows hard to lose but um if we were to if we were that the speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing that was what wed wed mentioned whether you want to or not youre not gonna lose it it could oops hmm just just to use to find it when it was lost but like i said like i dont think youd lose something so yellow so easily and its not gonna fall like a rectangle would slip down behind things thats gonna be a difficult shape to and yeah maybe in the middle again three or four or something yeah mm i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose i mean a million ways you can pick it up and walk away with it and then youve lost it thats true probably you probably yeah gonna be lost then yeah yeah yeah its its yeah true but i mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have theyre cheap so it cant be that annoying alarm or something yeah based on this anti expensive of proximity technology yeah yeah somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and stick it on the t_v_ right yeah two two two two its all just id say so uh dont get many mo remote controls with screens on its technology when it comes down to yeah its stolen technology but we have from ipod yeah course that wasnt right fa i dont know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth yeah cause its stolen no maybe not not yeah kind of sort of yeah as much as as needed i think on the back yeah yeah id say you betcha yeah the in the l_c_d_ on the the form yeah be what we were told and theyd say yeah definitely seven is that some long division no just im sure theres a okay well say two point four no i cant do long very impressive its been a while yeah yeah so youd been going a long time dividing that its two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on oh two point four two basically charge about three hundred quid for it probably take probably thats the were advanced chip are we yeah yeah right but its not special pushbutton s and an l_c_d_ thats yeah and then or is it yes id say the integrated mm all the same well we only have uh just remote control we shouldnt be charged anything no thats getting a bit the tiny yeah id ignore that a bananashaped if it w what if we completely took out the the one single button weve got on and just had a scroll wheel interface and the l_c_d_ display i suppose the l_c_d_ c_ displays the one thats pushing it up a bit though yeah on the television yeah away the yeah yeah yeah you could maybe take out the l_c_d_ dis display even if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself uh that is possible yeah twelve there we go screen here screen make it a bigger dial easier to use even easier to use then does central oh thats just yeah that was just we ran out of yellow oh thats the batteries okay you go oops there you go even simpler there you go one more criteria yeah for all those fruit lovers out there now its yes yeah good great yeah i think we did yeah i think we did quite well um good teamwork there you go yeah right from the start of the day i think we st we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought was the whiteboard and the pens super yeah weve used the whiteboard theyve just a list of employees yes technology technology used excellent plug that in there but remo the banana but it would be held button thats um its you know its flimsy cause its made out pretty impressive kind of a banana um do you have a marketing presentation i do okay you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria um okay so first ill just discuss some of the criteria that i found just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier and then well do a group evaluation of the prototype and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did um so the criteria were gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier so were gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that with seven being false we did not achieve that okay so for the first one we need to decide did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote definitely different mm i would say i would i would mm when we dont have a say in that that has some people might say yeah i think the colours detract a little bit thats true with the ugly remote yeah um okay so do you think since we yeah yeah this was a a sign criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then does that sound good what do you think three four i would say four yeah five four is fair okay okay the second one did we make it simple for new users yeah one kay okay um do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users cause weve weve id say that i think thats a one so thats a one so one yeah okay something that big okay um the fourth one how about the problem of a remote being easily lost one of the number one complaints dont lose anymore yeah its bright yellow bright yellows hard to lose but um whether you want to or not youre not gonna lose it yeah uh s okay mm it thats true do go with the mm with its its but i mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have annoying alarm or something yeah right so are we adding one of these lets add one of those features and say yes two features gonna say okay two two two so were back to a one or a two two kay okay are we technologically innovative its technology when it comes down to yeah its stolen technology but we from ipod yeah but theres not a lot of yellow theres not a lotta yellow right but for remotes yeah two three if we added the screaming but how many remotes do you see like this not so many really okay thats gonna hurt us okay um spongy material kay possibly even a five and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics if your fashion more yeah id say we did you betcha yeah kay alright now we just gotta calculate six eight twelve sixteen seventeen divided by s is eight something well i havent done math in years just what two i dunno okay well say two point four two right how does that look no i cant do long very impressive its been a while to hit oh no they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically so thats that on two oh my god okay yeah well go with that so i have here not too shabby excellent they wont know until after they bought i yeah right nice right oh its a specially ugly bright yellow but its not special the say or titanium they cost us all mmhmm or titanium itd look really lovely yeah only have one button so really we shouldnt be charged we shouldnt no yeah okay leave it blank what if we completely cause the twelve point five go perfect screen here make it a besides does to our lovely remote okay so central oh thats just yeah that was just we ran out of yellow whats the blue part oh thats the batteries okay simpler looks more like a banana more criteria out there next fair enough trying to fill in some time there good just half a day you have a remote there you go yeah good teamwork but minus your well minus your powerpoint fiasco well obviously the people i work for uh that work for me uh theyve just you know no i know im yeah incom we have a list of employees that you would like fired believe me yes yes mm kinda the last meeting and then well have to check with the we might have a while though

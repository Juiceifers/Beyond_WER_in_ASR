okay . oh , that's not gonna work . oh , alright . okay . okay . um alright . uh , uh , um . i'll just put that there . uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . uh i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . go ahead . 'kay . okay . um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . um so we are putting together a new remote control . um we want it to be something original . um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . and w uh well um functional design um . um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . so we want it to be um a t_v_ remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? 'kay . mm-hmm . 'kay . i i think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , so i think we're all in the same boat here . ye yeah . huh . ours too . um okay . mm so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh , i thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . like a tracking device or or like a a oh you can get those key well you could whistle ? it makes a noise , there's a button on the t_v_ that you press and mm , mm . and it'd beep . yeah . mm . 'kay . yeah . do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular . do we want something crazy ? you know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . a m a modern so our remote should be just long . yeah . black usually . yeah . i think so . maybe sorta spherical lot more modern . 'kay . maybe the actual controls um . mm . okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it , have to buy one every half a year ? yeah . yeah . it could be cased 'kay . um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , . um so our form and our function . um we want it to be um easy to find . um what else it what else do we want it to to do ? so we want it to be universal . it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros um and you know , goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros , what they wanna make on it , so . mm . 'kay . so marketing , you know , how maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . yeah 'kay . , 'cause maybe um do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . some ideas ? we want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . i'd i could draw sorta the ball idea . . but yeah . futuristic . uh-huh . how would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? not to put you on the spot , but e no no , uh uh what did you say your title was again ? n n you're the the industrial designer . your industrial designer , so b well , the point is okay . . as yeah . there's nothing it's not new , it's not innovative , it's you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um . left field , yeah . yeah . so if no , go ahead . . what something with a grip . yeah , with a grip mm . yeah yeah . because even i suppose even with the ball it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . mm . it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we like yeah . yeah . it's d yeah . i true . i feel like i'm just shooting everything down here . uh um that's fine . you're yeah . if the remote is . okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . so let's see here . what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . so you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . course that'll then remove some of our our ball . unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . yeah . so the grip is no , that wouldn't work either um . but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess , um and then flat uh and then we have the problem with the hinge . so if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . mm , that's true . it's probably so we don't have it flip open . too stable uh . we just have a ball okay , so then we forget the ball . it looks cool , but it's really not it's not functional um . so we've got our sort of keyboard kind . what if we flipped it around here , so that it were um it looks cool . uh functional . looks cool though . yeah . sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you had there . um so it's up and down , you hold it this way . course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . but it's one-handed um . right . right . yeah . yeah . , right mm . yeah . we'll not yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . you know , all that dif batteries right , and is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? so that either way you're pointing it it would work . i suppose you could do that . o of course more expensive and yeah . it'll cost , so . 'kay . um true . the buttons and 'kay . sorry are we out of time ? okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some mm . to finish . yeah . are good ideas , what are not . uh . must finish now , so . and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . t mm . okay . and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . and uh alright , good meeting . okay . right . i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in in this project um . in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . um i suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . um um in the conceptual design um i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . and uh the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . okay . yeah . have the same role mm . think they all work a noise , there's a button on the t_v_ mm , mm . it'd beep . right . so . a ball mm . i thought maybe well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . what are we gonna build that thing out of ? how sturdy is it gonna be ? do we want it to last longer or rather have people yeah . mm . okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? yeah . and maybe as far right . , and then you'd have was that was a sorta simple right . one problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . that's one of the big issues . also also you risk the hinges here . that's that's um a problem . yeah . yeah . maybe f yeah . yeah , that's g that's a good idea . yeah . the idea it didn't have to necessarily that's that's interesting of course , but that's of course a weak point , yeah . a hinge , that was just one idea though . yeah . you on the spot , but e no no , uh uh . what did you say your title was again n n you're the the industrial designer . uh , i'm your industrial designer , so i b well , the point is that okay . well maybe i dunno . the shape is perhaps not the most ideal . as as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . well i i suppose that things become design . but i mean i mm-hmm . mm . um mm . yeah . well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . so if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but yeah . may not be th as functional . so for that there's so the question is also , i dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? true . so we don't have it flip open . it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so i don't know if a lid is a good idea . from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . so it's don't make it too stable uh . to the other design . something along those things then . it looks cool , but it's really not it looks cool . looks cool though . yeah . functional uh functional . points . but right . right . yeah . yeah . question is what makes those game pads functional ? w i think that's pretty much the form for full hand . so it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . except for that i think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . mm . 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks you know , all that dif batteries right , and batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? so , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . that either way you're pointing it it would work . more expensive and yeah i suppose you could do that . o of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . course you can do that . true . i mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . put it mm . let's . obviously does it say what does it say for n it alright . around , be a little bit more prepared . hiya , i'm ryan . um i'm the user interface designer . um likewise i've three different roles for each stage of design . um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . that's about it . um yeah . . uh tool training yeah . well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function . 'kay . oh right . i suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . but , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . mm . mm . i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i don't actually know . but is it just infra-red ? is that standard ? i think yeah , yeah ye yeah . um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . so we should we should set so if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , i thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . ch or or like a a it makes a noise , there's oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep . and yeah . generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . . do we want just long . rectangular . do we want something yeah . black usually . know , we want something yeah . . a m a modern i think so . should be maybe sorta spherical or something . a ball . yeah . 'kay . mm . people i thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . type thing . the same time yeah . we want it to be half a year yeah . ball-shaped yeah . , then it it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . ye one small . all a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the i'd i could draw sorta the ball idea . my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . if that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . thing is inside i think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . um , i dunno , what's the idea for . just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . it's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair . but yeah . futuristic uh-huh . that was that was a sorta simple idea i had and then you know you could about right right , it would almost be like a ball . so that was just just an idea i had . i don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? really yeah . we'd have yeah . one side at least maybe f yeah . . also also yeah , that's g that's a good idea . . that's that's um a problem . that's yeah . the idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though . . yeah . um stability and design here , so . well i i suppose that things become design . but i mean i mm-hmm . yeah . it's not new , it's not innovative , it's i was trying to think of like the design of others . i can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . easy yeah . yeah . games i think definitely doing something different is a good idea . i mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh i suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . . yeah , with a grip . . yeah . it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . the the like yeah . , so maybe yeah . we it's d yeah . i think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . mm . . uh so it's easier yeah . to the other design . but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . course then it's yeah . an instinctual put it 'kay . even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . yeah . um to interrupt uh let's . obviously does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , i think . finish t alright uh , uh , um . . okay . i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role . in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . . uh tool training , project mm . huh . , so i think we're all in the same boat here . ours too . so mm . a way of finding ch like a tracking device like a tracking device ? and yeah mm . . be good . that's gonna stand out lot more modern . maybe like user-friendly , like a little people you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . mm . mm . . mm . also since we're partners of the international remote control association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . that's more on the research end , but the marketing . out there . yeah . 'kay . ye small . and maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . , to be fair . futuristic . that ? you're the uh , i'm your industrial designer . , so here . but mm-hmm . so if no , go ahead . 'kay , i'll draw something . what ? my idea was just to have it be kind of like a yeah . keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky . we could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . i don't know . that's my idea . yeah . with a grip . yeah , with a grip mm . yeah . , so maybe yeah . true . mm . . uh um that's fine . you're the boss , you're allowed to . yeah if the remote yeah . . it looks cool , but it's really not it looks cool . looks cool though . yeah . , only with a couple of jutting out points right . right yeah . , right mm . right . you got something like that instead yeah . are we out of time mm . um sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . yeah . want mm . great . around , be a little bit more prepared

yep . soon as i get this . okay . this is our last meeting . um i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . um then we will um do an evaluation . uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . um we looked at uh the the trends . we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . um and a spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . um looking at other other devices . um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . but i think we've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . so i'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . the prototype yeah . do you need a this ? okay . . but very nice . , where you , where you'd mm-hmm . , so yeah much make much difference what but what's that button ? not do it at all just uh , 'kay . on-off button . 'kay . right um would you like to uh right . , but well done . well luckily we are going to find out . or not luckily . um do you have a marketing presentation for us . i do . i think it's definitely different than anything else out there . so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes i would say , i would say most definitely . it's bright . yeah . i would . it's mm . it still has your traditional black . yep , not angular . it . mm . pretty much by the company yep . uh to . , definitely yeah yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form . right . right yeah . yeah ? i would say five four . yeah ? four is fair . okay . very non-committal , four . . yeah . , 'kay mm-hmm . . channel and volume s scrolling through and selecting a few . scrolling further . yeah . i think that's a one . lose anymore . yeah . it's bright whether you want so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could mentioned . just just to use and it is quite bright and what yeah uh s okay . yeah . , i mean a million but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit i think . oh yeah mm . probably two . you know . if we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then . yeah . i'd say two . with the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a so far . yes . yeah it's you have . they're cheap . some sort of proximity technology for suitcases yeah . pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . right . that'd be tough then yeah okay . two . . ? two , 'kay . it's comes down to technology . but we yeah . but there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour . right right right right . fa but for remotes yeah . i don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . yeah not really . 'cause it's stolen . no maybe not . but if we added the screaming factor then we go up . um i would say we're probably at four . right . so many . really we have some spongy , yeah . that , kind of , sort yeah as much as no . . one would be the yeah . because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . to fold and stuff . yeah . yeah . probably a four at most . at most . possibly even a five . and lastly y yes if your fashion is b is carmen miranda , you betcha . . more yeah . did . it's true . and the way you operate seven is . two point two point four ? is that some long division something . well i haven't done math and what what is the acceptable criteria ? is there like a scale that we have to hit ? oh no it alright then . okay . well , let's see . now we get to do the budget numbers . you didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . but we do . okay . yeah . yeah so i have here an fifty percent not too shabby . yeah . we want a fifty percent profit on this . oh you can't really see that very well . twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us . okay , so well let's see . the f the um wonder if i can make this what the oh it won't let me do that . okay . alright so at top , i don't know if you guys can read that or not . i can't 'cause i don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . there's uh four , five , six categories . we have energy source , electronics , case . then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . battery . okay so uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? probably some e either two or four . two ? like it . at four it's gonna excellent . they won't know until after they this is consumerism . alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . . 'kay , we have one of those . 'kay then the case is a probably it's double curved . double curved , yes case materials are plastic . plastic . um i guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . is that right or is it just one ? n no maybe it's one because of the one . 'kay . . yeah i guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . special colour ? exactly , right . oh . interface type . we have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an l_c_d_ display . , but it's not special . s s that's yeah so we actually have the l_c_d_ display and then is it the integrated or is it i'd say the integrated yeah . unfortunately 'kay . button supplement ? special colour ? um special form ? special material . mm . . say mahogany or so or titanium . they cost us all the same . mm-hmm or titanium . remote . yeah . well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . just . no that's getting a bit tiny . um okay . we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l_c_d_ and scroll . so our total is fifteen point five . which i believe is yeah that's too much . by three euros over . huh ? so the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . if it w what yeah 'cause the well 'cause we have to have both right ? yeah mm-hmm . . so so we may not need the l_c_d_ display ? uh well there we go . twelve point five . . perfect . there we go . perfect . okay . so we just remove our screen here . . make it a bigger . besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote . back to the design room boys . so . . okay so the costs under twelve point five euro . was no . we redesigned it . now it's yes . next slide . project evaluation . uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . um yeah . so i guess that let's see here . i think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . but i'd like to hear your thoughts . fair enough trying to fill in some time there uh h what did you think of our project process ? . . yeah i think we did good . good teamwork yeah i think we sort of knew where we st we started off a little little weak . our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . um um straight away i thought . but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . um room for creativity ? there was that . um i think we tried a lotta different things and um i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . um you guys worked together well as a team . and um the means ? which was the whiteboard and the pens . yeah . we've used the whiteboard . i had some problem with the pen i think , but minus your p well that's not my minus your powerpoint fiasco . well that work yeah just you have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired . heads are gonna roll , believe me . okay . n new ideas found ? um yes for the remote . maybe no not f for technology . . alright . closing . costs are within the budget . project is evaluated . um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . that's it . and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . actually . um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . but that's the end of our meeting . . a while though . can try to plug that in there but there is our remo right . that's what we have there . that's plastic . plastic covered with rubber . we might anything you want to add ? mm-hmm . uh add some more underneath here . maybe give it , give it a form . i mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . exactly , use both . might as well think about yeah . doesn't make much make much difference . you could work left-handed or right-handed i suppose . t the actual thing might be th think about the button as well . like either put either one one on either side or . yeah . what's that button ? uh , 'kay . not do it at all . it's a quick on-off button . that's um just the on and off . yeah i think it's pretty important . so you don't have to fiddle with that . . right ? um that's not um i'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . you wanna play with that over there . there you go . yeah . it's you to uh right . . um ? yep , not angular . angles to it . i'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . however the colour , we don't have a say in that . yeah i think the colours detract a little mm . yep . that has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 's nothing you can say about that . i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . but say it . yeah . yeah . yeah . . that's true . yeah . a a modern right . right . it's different . you don't want your uh three feet huge l_c_d_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . yeah . what do you think . very non-committal yeah . is fair . okay . it's very intuitive , i think yeah . s give it a one . aim , one of the main aims that we had . one mm-hmm right . , which are channel . right . . so that's a one . one ? yeah something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . yeah complaints . whether . bright yellow's hard to lose . but um if we were to , you're not gonna lose it . oops . don't think you'd hmm . it's not gonna fall and it is quite bright well what uh s okay . mm . true . i think . probably two oh yeah . you probably yeah . mm . with the y you could add an extra feature actually . which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . which , which may we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . were just a yes . it's it's key rings you have . they're cheap ? yeah . some sort of proximity um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . that can't cost much . expensive . yeah . so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other stick it on the t_v_ . . right . that'd be tough then . well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . okay . let's add one of those features and say yes . ? gonna say okay . so we're back to a one two . two . . ? two , 'kay . uh so it's all just remote controls it's but there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right . yeah it's stolen technology . but we have . fa from ipod yeah . but for remotes yeah . you the truth . yeah not really . not . but if we added ? not so many . um right . we have some spongy , yeah . yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . yeah as much as no . it's not a one though . one would be the whole thing got what to fold and stuff . the bottom yeah . probably a four so that's a four at most . if your fashion y yes . more yeah . i'd say we did , you betcha yeah it's true . well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l_c_d_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is on the yeah . be what we . two i'm impressed . i can't do that without a calculator . no i can't do long very impressive . it's been a while . pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate so i have here an yeah . we want a fifty percent fifty percent , you're kidding . p not too shabby . it's too much . let's see um uh . i can't 'cause i don't have my glasses four battery . two two . . at four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . people can change it every month . excellent . they won't know until after they bought it . this is consumerism , sample sensor that's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . ? double curved . double curved , yes . plastic plastic . . is that right or is it just one ? maybe it's one because n no . no that's just one . 'kay it's just one mo single mould , we can do that . yeah , which is nice . special exactly , right . oh . that's not a special colour . it's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . bright yellow . , integrated scroll-wheel s yeah . yes unfortunately . . we could of course make the buttons wood . say mahogany or so or titanium . they cost us all mm-hmm or titanium . . yeah . well we only have uh just . really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the no that's getting a bit tiny is yeah that's too much . it's hard to believe . so we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? took out the the one single button we've got mm-hmm . i mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . so s yeah let's take away the yeah . yeah you could maybe take yeah . yeah . display even , if it if it so right . right . we may not need it . well there we go there you go . perfect . there we go screen screen . easier to use besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote . back to the design okay , the so we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . . central ? oh that's just yeah . that was just we ran out of yellow what's the blue part ? oh that's the batteries . okay there you go . oops . there you go . even there you go . one more criteria . all those fruit lovers out there . uh fair enough . trying to fill in some time there . great . i think we did yeah i think we yeah . just half a day , you have a remote . there you go . yeah . right . i super super . minus your p well well that's not my fault . that's obviously the people i work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know fiasco . no i know . i'm yeah . incom have a we have a list of employees heads are gonna roll , believe me . yes yes . we'll have to check with the though the prototype the prototype discussion . okay no . can try to plug that in there but there is our remo the banana . um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . very nice . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . so that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination a little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . it's that that simple . that just represents the infrared uh beam . right . that's that's a simple on and off switch . um i don't know , we could use the voice . t that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be i suppose . and um that's about it . it's as simple as you , we could make it really . is there anything you want to add ? mm-hmm . it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . exactly yeah . doesn't make much make much difference . you could work left-handed or right-handed i suppose . think about th think about the button as well . like either t the actual thing might be smaller . yeah . ? uh . it's a quick on-off just the on and off . . you yeah . would you like to go . right it's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play-doh , but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose . with the scroll and the l_c_d_ . i think it's . else out there yeah . i would say , i would i would . . it's bright . it's it's curved . it's not there's no sharp yep angles to it . that has been , that has some people might say it . yeah . bit . yeah . with yeah . . yeah . ? s yeah . i think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . mm-hmm . s scrolling through and selecting a few right . uh yeah . 'cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . and then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . yeah . i'd say that so if we don't lose anymore . yeah . it's bright yellow . bright yellow's hard to lose . but um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . that was what we'd we'd mentioned . whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . it could oops . hmm . just just to use , to find it when it was lost . but like i said , like i don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . and it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . that's gonna be a difficult shape to and yeah . maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? yeah . mm i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , i mean a million ways . you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . that's true . probably . you probably yeah . gonna be lost then yeah . yeah . yeah . it's it's yeah true . but i mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . they're cheap . so it can't be that annoying alarm or something ? yeah . based on this anti expensive . of proximity technology yeah . . yeah . somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and stick it on the t_v_ . right yeah . two two two . ? two it's all just i'd say so . uh don't get many mo remote controls with screens on . it's technology when it comes down to yeah it's stolen technology . but we have . from ipod yeah . . course that wasn't right fa i don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth yeah 'cause it's stolen . no maybe not . ? not , yeah . , kind of , sort of . yeah as much as as needed , i think . on the back . yeah . yeah . i'd say , you betcha . yeah . the in the l_c_d_ on the the form yeah . be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . seven ? is that some long division ? no . just , i'm sure there's a . okay we'll say two point four no i can't do long very impressive . it's been a while . yeah . yeah so . you'd been going a long time dividing that . it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . oh two point four two basically . . . charge about three hundred quid for it . probably take ? probably that's the we're advanced chip are we ? . . yeah yeah . right , but it's not special . pushbutton s , and an l_c_d_ that's yeah . and then or is it yes i'd say the integrated . mm . all the same . well we only have . uh just remote control . , we shouldn't be charged anything no that's getting a bit the tiny . yeah . i'd ignore that . a banana-shaped if it w what if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . and just had a scroll wheel interface . and the l_c_d_ display . i suppose the l_c_d_ c_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . yeah . on the television yeah . away the yeah . yeah . yeah you could maybe take out the l_c_d_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself . ? uh that is possible yeah . . twelve . there we go . screen here . screen . make it a bigger dial . easier to use . even easier to use then . does central ? oh that's just yeah . that was just we ran out of yellow . ? oh that's the batteries . okay you go . oops . there you go . even simpler . there you go . one more criteria . yeah . for all those fruit lovers out there . . now it's yes yeah . good . great . yeah . i think we did yeah i think we did quite well . um good teamwork . there you go . yeah . right from the start of the day . . i think we st we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought . was the whiteboard and the pens . super yeah . we've used the whiteboard . they've just a list of employees . . yes technology technology used . excellent . plug that in there but remo the banana but it would be held button . that's um it's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out pretty impressive . kind of a banana . . um do you have a marketing presentation i do . okay . you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . um . okay . so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that i found . just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier . and then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . so we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . with seven being false , we did not achieve that . okay . so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? definitely different mm . i would say , i would i would . mm . , when , we don't have a say in that . that has some people might say yeah i think the colours detract a little bit . that's true . with the ugly remote yeah . um okay so , do you think , since we yeah yeah . this was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? does that sound good ? what do you think ? three ? four ? i would say four . yeah five ? four is fair . okay . okay , the second one . did we make it simple for new users ? yeah . . one , 'kay . okay . um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? . 'cause we've we've i'd say that i think that's a one . so that's a one . so one ? yeah ? okay . something that big okay um the fourth one . how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? one of the number one complaints . don't lose anymore . yeah . it's bright yellow . bright yellow's hard to lose . but um whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . yeah uh s okay . mm . it . that's true . do go with the mm . with it's it's . but i mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have annoying alarm or something ? yeah . right so . are we adding one of these let's add one of those features and say yes two features ? gonna say okay . two . . two . two . so we're back to a one ? or a two ? two , 'kay . okay . are we technologically innovative ? it's technology when it comes down to yeah it's stolen technology . but we from ipod yeah . but there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow right but for remotes yeah . two ? three ? if we added the screaming but how many remotes do you see like this ? not so many . really ? okay . that's gonna hurt us . okay . um spongy material ? 'kay . possibly even a five . and lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? if your fashion . more yeah . i'd say we did . , you betcha yeah . 'kay . alright . now we just gotta calculate . six eight twelve sixteen . seventeen divided by s is eight . something . well i haven't done math in years . just what two i dunno . . okay we'll say two point four two . right ? how does that look ? . no i can't do long very impressive . it's been a while . to hit ? oh no . they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . so that's that . . on . two oh my god . okay . yeah we'll go with that . so i have here not too shabby . excellent . they won't know until after they bought i yeah . right . nice , right oh . . it's a specially ugly bright yellow . , but it's not special . the . say or titanium . they cost us all mm-hmm or titanium . it'd look really lovely . yeah . only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't . no yeah okay leave it blank . ? . what if we completely 'cause the . twelve point five . go . perfect . screen here . make it a besides does to our lovely remote . okay . so central ? oh that's just yeah . that was just we ran out of yellow . what's the blue part ? oh that's the batteries . okay . simpler . looks more like a banana . more criteria . out there . . next fair enough trying to fill in some time there . good . just half a day , you have a remote . there you go . yeah good teamwork . , but minus your well minus your powerpoint fiasco . well obviously the people i work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know no i know . i'm yeah . incom we have a list of employees that you would like fired . , believe me . yes yes . mm . kinda . the last meeting and then we'll have to check with the . we might have a while though .
